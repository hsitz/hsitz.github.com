<p>  What is the problem we wish to solve when we try to construct a rational 
  economic order? On certain familiar assumptions the answer is simple enough. 
  If we possess all the relevant information, if we can start out from a given 
  system of preferences, and if we command complete knowledge of available 
  means, the problem which remains is purely one of logic. That is, the answer 
  to the question of what is the best use of the available means is implicit 
  in our assumptions. The conditions which the solution of this optimum 
  problem must satisfy have been fully worked out and can be stated best in 
  mathematical form: put at their briefest, they are that the marginal rates 
  of substitution between any two commodities or factors must be the same in 
  all their different uses.
</p>
<p>
  This, however, is emphatically not the economic problem which society faces. 
  And the economic calculus which we have developed to solve this logical 
  problem, though an important step toward the solution of the economic 
  problem of society, does not yet provide an answer to it. The reason for 
  this is that the "data" from which the economic calculus starts are never 
  for the whole society "given" to a single mind which could work out the 
  implications and can never be so given.
</p>
<p>
  The peculiar character of the problem of a rational economic order is 
  determined precisely by the fact that the knowledge of the circumstances of 
  which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form but 
  solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory 
  knowledge which all the separate individuals possess. The economic problem 
  of society is thus not merely a problem of how to allocate "given" 
  resources—if "given" is taken to mean given to a single mind which 
  deliberately solves the problem set by these "data." It is rather a problem 
  of how to secure the best use of resources known to any of the members of 
  society, for ends whose relative importance only these individuals know. Or, 
  to put it briefly, it is a problem of the utilization of knowledge which is 
  not given to anyone in its totality.
</p>
<p>
  This character of the fundamental problem has, I am afraid, been obscured 
  rather than illuminated by many of the recent refinements of economic 
  theory, particularly by many of the uses made of mathematics. Though the 
  problem with which I want primarily to deal in this paper is the problem of 
  a rational economic organization, I shall in its course be led again and 
  again to point to its close connections with certain methodological 
  questions. Many of the points I wish to make are indeed conclusions toward 
  which diverse paths of reasoning have unexpectedly converged. But, as I now 
  see these problems, this is no accident. It seems to me that many of the 
  current disputes with regard to both economic theory and economic policy 
  have their common origin in a misconception about the nature of the economic 
  problem of society. This misconception in turn is due to an erroneous 
  transfer to social phenomena of the habits of thought we have developed in 
  dealing with the phenomena of nature.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>  In ordinary language we describe by the word "planning" the complex of 
  interrelated decisions about the allocation of our available resources. All 
  economic activity is in this sense planning; and in any society in which 
  many people collaborate, this planning, whoever does it, will in some 
  measure have to be based on knowledge which, in the first instance, is not 
  given to the planner but to somebody else, which somehow will have to be 
  conveyed to the planner. The various ways in which the knowledge on which 
  people base their plans is communicated to them is the crucial problem for 
  any theory explaining the economic process, and the problem of what is the 
  best way of utilizing knowledge initially dispersed among all the people is 
  at least one of the main problems of economic policy—or of designing an 
  efficient economic system.
</p>
<p>
  The answer to this question is closely connected with that other question 
  which arises here, that of who is to do the planning. It is about this 
  question that all the dispute about "economic planning" centers. This is not 
  a dispute about whether planning is to be done or not. It is a dispute as to 
  whether planning is to be done centrally, by one authority for the whole 
  economic system, or is to be divided among many individuals. Planning in the 
  specific sense in which the term is used in contemporary controversy 
  necessarily means central planning—direction of the whole economic system 
  according to one unified plan. Competition, on the other hand, means 
  decentralized planning by many separate persons. The halfway house between 
  the two, about which many people talk but which few like when they see it, 
  is the delegation of planning to organized industries, or, in other words, 
  monopoly.
</p>
<p>
  Which of these systems is likely to be more efficient depends mainly on the 
  question under which of them we can expect that fuller use will be made of 
  the existing knowledge. And this, in turn, depends on whether we are more 
  likely to succeed in putting at the disposal of a single central authority 
  all the knowledge which ought to be used but which is initially dispersed 
  among many different individuals, or in conveying to the individuals such 
  additional knowledge as they need in order to enable them to fit their plans 
  with those of others.

<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> III</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>  It will at once be evident that on this point the position will be different 
  with respect to different kinds of knowledge; and the answer to our question 
  will therefore largely turn on the relative importance of the different 
  kinds of knowledge; those more likely to be at the disposal of particular 
  individuals and those which we should with greater confidence expect to find 
  in the possession of an authority made up of suitably chosen experts. If it 
  is today so widely assumed that the latter will be in a better position, 
  this is because one kind of knowledge, namely, scientific knowledge, 
  occupies now so prominent a place in public imagination that we tend to 
  forget that it is not the only kind that is relevant. It may be admitted 
  that, as far as scientific knowledge is concerned, a body of suitably chosen 
  experts may be in the best position to command all the best knowledge 
  available—though this is of course merely shifting the difficulty to the 
  problem of selecting the experts. What I wish to point out is that, even 
  assuming that this problem can be readily solved, it is only a small part of 
  the wider problem.
</p>
<p>
  Today it is almost heresy to suggest that scientific knowledge is not the 
  sum of all knowledge. But a little reflection will show that there is beyond 
  question a body of very important but unorganized knowledge which cannot 
  possibly be called scientific in the sense of knowledge of general rules: 
  the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place. It is with 
  respect to this that practically every individual has some advantage over 
  all others because he possesses unique information of which beneficial use 
  might be made, but of which use can be made only if the decisions depending 
  on it are left to him or are made with his active coöperation. We need to 
  remember only how much we have to learn in any occupation after we have 
  completed our theoretical training, how big a part of our working life we 
  spend learning particular jobs, and how valuable an asset in all walks of 
  life is knowledge of people, of local conditions, and of special 
  circumstances. To know of and put to use a machine not fully employed, or 
  somebody's skill which could be better utilized, or to be aware of a surplus 
  stock which can be drawn upon during an interruption of supplies, is 
  socially quite as useful as the knowledge of better alternative techniques. 
  And the shipper who earns his living from using otherwise empty or 
  half-filled journeys of tramp-steamers, or the estate agent whose whole 
  knowledge is almost exclusively one of temporary opportunities, or the 
  arbitrageur who gains from local differences of commodity prices, are all 
  performing eminently useful functions based on special knowledge of 
  circumstances of the fleeting moment not known to others.
</p>
<p>
  It is a curious fact that this sort of knowledge should today be generally 
  regarded with a kind of contempt and that anyone who by such knowledge gains 
  an advantage over somebody better equipped with theoretical or technical 
  knowledge is thought to have acted almost disreputably. To gain an advantage 
  from better knowledge of facilities of communication or transport is 
  sometimes regarded as almost dishonest, although it is quite as important 
  that society make use of the best opportunities in this respect as in using 
  the latest scientific discoveries. This prejudice has in a considerable 
  measure affected the attitude toward commerce in general compared with that 
  toward production. Even economists who regard themselves as definitely 
  immune to the crude materialist fallacies of the past constantly commit the 
  same mistake where activities directed toward the acquisition of such 
  practical knowledge are concerned—apparently because in their scheme of 
  things all such knowledge is supposed to be "given." The common idea now 
  seems to be that all such knowledge should as a matter of course be readily 
  at the command of everybody, and the reproach of irrationality leveled 
  against the existing economic order is frequently based on the fact that it 
  is not so available. This view disregards the fact that the method by which 
  such knowledge can be made as widely available as possible is precisely the 
  problem to which we have to find an answer.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">

<p>  If it is fashionable today to minimize the importance of the knowledge of 
  the particular circumstances of time and place, this is closely connected 
  with the smaller importance which is now attached to change as such. Indeed, 
  there are few points on which the assumptions made (usually only implicitly) 
  by the "planners" differ from those of their opponents as much as with 
  regard to the significance and frequency of changes which will make 
  substantial alterations of production plans necessary. Of course, if 
  detailed economic plans could be laid down for fairly long periods in 
  advance and then closely adhered to, so that no further economic decisions 
  of importance would be required, the task of drawing up a comprehensive plan 
  governing all economic activity would be much less formidable.
</p>
<p>
  It is, perhaps, worth stressing that economic problems arise always and only 
  in consequence of change. So long as things continue as before, or at least 
  as they were expected to, there arise no new problems requiring a decision, 
  no need to form a new plan. The belief that changes, or at least day-to-day 
  adjustments, have become less important in modern times implies the 
  contention that economic problems also have become less important. This 
  belief in the decreasing importance of change is, for that reason, usually 
  held by the same people who argue that the importance of economic 
  considerations has been driven into the background by the growing importance 
  of technological knowledge.
</p>
<p>
  Is it true that, with the elaborate apparatus of modern production, economic 
  decisions are required only at long intervals, as when a new factory is to 
  be erected or a new process to be introduced? Is it true that, once a plant 
  has been built, the rest is all more or less mechanical, determined by the 
  character of the plant, and leaving little to be changed in adapting to the 
  ever-changing circumstances of the moment?
</p>
<p>
  The fairly widespread belief in the affirmative is not, as far as I can 
  ascertain, borne out by the practical experience of the businessman. In a 
  competitive industry at any rate—and such an industry alone can serve as a 
  test—the task of keeping cost from rising requires constant struggle, 
  absorbing a great part of the energy of the manager. How easy it is for an 
  inefficient manager to dissipate the differentials on which profitability 
  rests, and that it is possible, with the same technical facilities, to 
  produce with a great variety of costs, are among the commonplaces of 
  business experience which do not seem to be equally familiar in the study of 
  the economist. The very strength of the desire, constantly voiced by 
  producers and engineers, to be allowed to proceed untrammeled by 
  considerations of money costs, is eloquent testimony to the extent to which 
  these factors enter into their daily work.
</p>
<p>
  One reason why economists are increasingly apt to forget about the constant 
  small changes which make up the whole economic picture is probably their 
  growing preoccupation with statistical aggregates, which show a very much 
  greater stability than the movements of the detail. The comparative 
  stability of the aggregates cannot, however, be accounted for—as the 
  statisticians occasionally seem to be inclined to do—by the "law of large 
  numbers" or the mutual compensation of random changes. The number of 
  elements with which we have to deal is not large enough for such accidental 
  forces to produce stability. The continuous flow of goods and services is 
  maintained by constant deliberate adjustments, by new dispositions made 
  every day in the light of circumstances not known the day before, by B 
  stepping in at once when A fails to deliver. Even the large and highly 
  mechanized plant keeps going largely because of an environment upon which it 
  can draw for all sorts of unexpected needs; tiles for its roof, stationery 
  for its forms, and all the thousand and one kinds of equipment in which it 
  cannot be self-contained and which the plans for the operation of the plant 
  require to be readily available in the market.
</p>
<p>
  This is, perhaps, also the point where I should briefly mention the fact 
  that the sort of knowledge with which I have been concerned is knowledge of 
  the kind which by its nature cannot enter into statistics and therefore 
  cannot be conveyed to any central authority in statistical form. The 
  statistics which such a central authority would have to use would have to be 
  arrived at precisely by abstracting from minor differences between the 
  things, by lumping together, as resources of one kind, items which differ as 
  regards location, quality, and other particulars, in a way which may be very 
  significant for the specific decision. It follows from this that central 
  planning based on statistical information by its nature cannot take direct 
  account of these circumstances of time and place and that the central 
  planner will have to find some way or other in which the decisions depending 
  on them can be left to the "man on the spot."
</p></div>

<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> V</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">

<p>  If we can agree that the economic problem of society is mainly one of rapid 
  adaptation to changes in the particular circumstances of time and place, it 
  would seem to follow that the ultimate decisions must be left to the people 
  who are familiar with these circumstances, who know directly of the relevant 
  changes and of the resources immediately available to meet them. We cannot 
  expect that this problem will be solved by first communicating all this 
  knowledge to a central board which, after integrating all knowledge, issues 
  its orders. We must solve it by some form of decentralization. But this 
  answers only part of our problem. We need decentralization because only thus 
  can we insure that the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and 
  place will be promptly used. But the "man on the spot" cannot decide solely 
  on the basis of his limited but intimate knowledge of the facts of his 
  immediate surroundings. There still remains the problem of communicating to 
  him such further information as he needs to fit his decisions into the whole 
  pattern of changes of the larger economic system.
</p>
<p>
  How much knowledge does he need to do so successfully? Which of the events 
  which happen beyond the horizon of his immediate knowledge are of relevance 
  to his immediate decision, and how much of them need he know?
</p>
<p>
  There is hardly anything that happens anywhere in the world that might not 
  have an effect on the decision he ought to make. But he need not know of 
  these events as such, nor of all their effects. It does not matter for him 
  why at the particular moment more screws of one size than of another are 
  wanted, why paper bags are more readily available than canvas bags, or why 
  skilled labor, or particular machine tools, have for the moment become more 
  difficult to obtain. All that is significant for him is how much more or 
  less difficult to procure they have become compared with other things with 
  which he is also concerned, or how much more or less urgently wanted are the 
  alternative things he produces or uses. It is always a question of the 
  relative importance of the particular things with which he is concerned, and 
  the causes which alter their relative importance are of no interest to him 
  beyond the effect on those concrete things of his own environment.
</p>
<p>
  It is in this connection that what I have called the "economic calculus" 
  proper helps us, at least by analogy, to see how this problem can be solved, 
  and in fact is being solved, by the price system. Even the single 
  controlling mind, in possession of all the data for some small, 
  self-contained economic system, would not—every time some small adjustment 
  in the allocation of resources had to be made—go explicitly through all the 
  relations between ends and means which might possibly be affected. It is 
  indeed the great contribution of the pure logic of choice that it has 
  demonstrated conclusively that even such a single mind could solve this kind 
  of problem only by constructing and constantly using rates of equivalence 
  (or "values," or "marginal rates of substitution"), i.e., by attaching to 
  each kind of scarce resource a numerical index which cannot be derived from 
  any property possessed by that particular thing, but which reflects, or in 
  which is condensed, its significance in view of the whole means-end 
  structure. In any small change he will have to consider only these 
  quantitative indices (or "values") in which all the relevant information is 
  concentrated; and, by adjusting the quantities one by one, he can 
  appropriately rearrange his dispositions without having to solve the whole 
  puzzle ab initio or without needing at any stage to survey it at once in all 
  its ramifications.
</p>
<p>
  Fundamentally, in a system in which the knowledge of the relevant facts is 
  dispersed among many people, prices can act to coördinate the separate 
  actions of different people in the same way as subjective values help the 
  individual to coördinate the parts of his plan. It is worth contemplating 
  for a moment a very simple and commonplace instance of the action of the 
  price system to see what precisely it accomplishes. Assume that somewhere in 
  the world a new opportunity for the use of some raw material, say, tin, has 
  arisen, or that one of the sources of supply of tin has been eliminated. It 
  does not matter for our purpose—and it is very significant that it does not 
  matter—which of these two causes has made tin more scarce. All that the 
  users of tin need to know is that some of the tin they used to consume is 
  now more profitably employed elsewhere and that, in consequence, they must 
  economize tin. There is no need for the great majority of them even to know 
  where the more urgent need has arisen, or in favor of what other needs they 
  ought to husband the supply. If only some of them know directly of the new 
  demand, and switch resources over to it, and if the people who are aware of 
  the new gap thus created in turn fill it from still other sources, the 
  effect will rapidly spread throughout the whole economic system and 
  influence not only all the uses of tin but also those of its substitutes and 
  the substitutes of these substitutes, the supply of all the things made of 
  tin, and their substitutes, and so on; and all this without the great 
  majority of those instrumental in bringing about these substitutions knowing 
  anything at all about the original cause of these changes. The whole acts as 
  one market, not because any of its members survey the whole field, but 
  because their limited individual fields of vision sufficiently overlap so 
  that through many intermediaries the relevant information is communicated to 
  all. The mere fact that there is one price for any commodity—or rather that 
  local prices are connected in a manner determined by the cost of transport, 
  etc.—brings about the solution which (it is just conceptually possible) 
  might have been arrived at by one single mind possessing all the information 
  which is in fact dispersed among all the people involved in the process.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">

<p>  We must look at the price system as such a mechanism for communicating 
  information if we want to understand its real function—a function which, of 
  course, it fulfils less perfectly as prices grow more rigid. (Even when 
  quoted prices have become quite rigid, however, the forces which would 
  operate through changes in price still operate to a considerable extent 
  through changes in the other terms of the contract.) The most significant 
  fact about this system is the economy of knowledge with which it operates, 
  or how little the individual participants need to know in order to be able 
  to take the right action. In abbreviated form, by a kind of symbol, only the 
  most essential information is passed on and passed on only to those 
  concerned. It is more than a metaphor to describe the price system as a kind 
  of machinery for registering change, or a system of telecommunications which 
  enables individual producers to watch merely the movement of a few pointers, 
  as an engineer might watch the hands of a few dials, in order to adjust 
  their activities to changes of which they may never know more than is 
  reflected in the price movement.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, these adjustments are probably never "perfect" in the sense in 
  which the economist conceives of them in his equilibrium analysis. But I 
  fear that our theoretical habits of approaching the problem with the 
  assumption of more or less perfect knowledge on the part of almost everyone 
  has made us somewhat blind to the true function of the price mechanism and 
  led us to apply rather misleading standards in judging its efficiency. The 
  marvel is that in a case like that of a scarcity of one raw material, 
  without an order being issued, without more than perhaps a handful of people 
  knowing the cause, tens of thousands of people whose identity could not be 
  ascertained by months of investigation, are made to use the material or its 
  products more sparingly; i.e., they move in the right direction. This is 
  enough of a marvel even if, in a constantly changing world, not all will hit 
  it off so perfectly that their profit rates will always be maintained at the 
  same constant or "normal" level.
</p>
<p>
  I have deliberately used the word "marvel" to shock the reader out of the 
  complacency with which we often take the working of this mechanism for 
  granted. I am convinced that if it were the result of deliberate human 
  design, and if the people guided by the price changes understood that their 
  decisions have significance far beyond their immediate aim, this mechanism 
  would have been acclaimed as one of the greatest triumphs of the human mind. 
  Its misfortune is the double one that it is not the product of human design 
  and that the people guided by it usually do not know why they are made to do 
  what they do. But those who clamor for "conscious direction"—and who cannot 
  believe that anything which has evolved without design (and even without our 
  understanding it) should solve problems which we should not be able to solve 
  consciously—should remember this: The problem is precisely how to extend the 
  span of our utilization of resources beyond the span of the control of any 
  one mind; and therefore, how to dispense with the need of conscious control, 
  and how to provide inducements which will make the individuals do the 
  desirable things without anyone having to tell them what to do.
</p>
<p>
  The problem which we meet here is by no means peculiar to economics but 
  arises in connection with nearly all truly social phenomena, with language 
  and with most of our cultural inheritance, and constitutes really the 
  central theoretical problem of all social science. As Alfred Whitehead has 
  said in another connection, "It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated 
  by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that 
  we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are doing. The precise 
  opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of 
  important operations which we can perform without thinking about them." This 
  is of profound significance in the social field. We make constant use of 
  formulas, symbols, and rules whose meaning we do not understand and through 
  the use of which we avail ourselves of the assistance of knowledge which 
  individually we do not possess. We have developed these practices and 
  institutions by building upon habits and institutions which have proved 
  successful in their own sphere and which have in turn become the foundation 
  of the civilization we have built up.
</p>
<p>
  The price system is just one of those formations which man has learned to 
  use (though he is still very far from having learned to make the best use of 
  it) after he had stumbled upon it without understanding it. Through it not 
  only a division of labor but also a coördinated utilization of resources 
  based on an equally divided knowledge has become possible. The people who 
  like to deride any suggestion that this may be so usually distort the 
  argument by insinuating that it asserts that by some miracle just that sort 
  of system has spontaneously grown up which is best suited to modern 
  civilization. It is the other way round: man has been able to develop that 
  division of labor on which our civilization is based because he happened to 
  stumble upon a method which made it possible. Had he not done so, he might 
  still have developed some other, altogether different, type of civilization, 
  something like the "state" of the termite ants, or some other altogether 
  unimaginable type. All that we can say is that nobody has yet succeeded in 
  designing an alternative system in which certain features of the existing 
  one can be preserved which are dear even to those who most violently assail 
  it—such as particularly the extent to which the individual can choose his 
  pursuits and consequently freely use his own knowledge and skill.

<p>  It is in many ways fortunate that the dispute about the indispensability of 
  the price system for any rational calculation in a complex society is now no 
  longer conducted entirely between camps holding different political views. 
  The thesis that without the price system we could not preserve a society 
  based on such extensive division of labor as ours was greeted with a howl of 
  derision when it was first advanced by von Mises twenty-five years ago. 
  Today the difficulties which some still find in accepting it are no longer 
  mainly political, and this makes for an atmosphere much more conducive to 
  reasonable discussion. When we find Leon Trotsky arguing that "economic 
  accounting is unthinkable without market relations"; when Professor Oscar 
  Lange promises Professor von Mises a statue in the marble halls of the 
  future Central Planning Board; and when Professor Abba P. Lerner rediscovers 
  Adam Smith and emphasizes that the essential utility of the price system 
  consists in inducing the individual, while seeking his own interest, to do 
  what is in the general interest, the differences can indeed no longer be 
  ascribed to political prejudice. The remaining dissent seems clearly to be 
  due to purely intellectual, and more particularly methodological, 
  differences.
</p>
<p>
  A recent statement by Professor Joseph Schumpeter in his Capitalism, 
  Socialism, and Democracy provides a clear illustration of one of the 
  methodological differences which I have in mind. Its author is pre-eminent 
  among those economists who approach economic phenomena in the light of a 
  certain branch of positivism. To him these phenomena accordingly appear as 
  objectively given quantities of commodities impinging directly upon each 
  other, almost, it would seem, without any intervention of human minds. Only 
  against this background can I account for the following (to me startling) 
  pronouncement. Professor Schumpeter argues that the possibility of a 
  rational calculation in the absence of markets for the factors of production 
  follows for the theorist "from the elementary proposition that consumers in 
  evaluating ('demanding') consumers' goods ipso facto also evaluate the means 
  of production which enter into the production of these goods."*1
</p>
<p>
  Taken literally, this statement is simply untrue. The consumers do nothing 
  of the kind. What Professor Schumpeter's "ipso facto" presumably means is 
  that the valuation of the factors of production is implied in, or follows 
  necessarily from, the valuation of consumers' goods. But this, too, is not 
  correct. Implication is a logical relationship which can be meaningfully 
  asserted only of propositions simultaneously present to one and the same 
  mind. It is evident, however, that the values of the factors of production 
  do not depend solely on the valuation of the consumers' goods but also on 
  the conditions of supply of the various factors of production. Only to a 
  mind to which all these facts were simultaneously known would the answer 
  necessarily follow from the facts given to it. The practical problem, 
  however, arises precisely because these facts are never so given to a single 
  mind, and because, in consequence, it is necessary that in the solution of 
  the problem knowledge should be used that is dispersed among many people.
</p>
<p>
  The problem is thus in no way solved if we can show that all the facts, if 
  they were known to a single mind (as we hypothetically assume them to be 
  given to the observing economist), would uniquely determine the solution; 
  instead we must show how a solution is produced by the interactions of 
  people each of whom possesses only partial knowledge. To assume all the 
  knowledge to be given to a single mind in the same manner in which we assume 
  it to be given to us as the explaining economists is to assume the problem 
  away and to disregard everything that is important and significant in the 
  real world.
</p>
<p>
  That an economist of Professor Schumpeter's standing should thus have fallen 
  into a trap which the ambiguity of the term "datum" sets to the unwary can 
  hardly be explained as a simple error. It suggests rather that there is 
  something fundamentally wrong with an approach which habitually disregards 
  an essential part of the phenomena with which we have to deal: the 
  unavoidable imperfection of man's knowledge and the consequent need for a 
  process by which knowledge is constantly communicated and acquired. Any 
  approach, such as that of much of mathematical economics with its 
  simultaneous equations, which in effect starts from the assumption that 
  people's knowledge corresponds with the objective facts of the situation, 
  systematically leaves out what is our main task to explain. I am far from 
  denying that in our system equilibrium analysis has a useful function to 
  perform. But when it comes to the point where it misleads some of our 
  leading thinkers into believing that the situation which it describes has 
  direct relevance to the solution of practical problems, it is high time that 
  we remember that it does not deal with the social process at all and that it 
  is no more than a useful preliminary to the study of the main problem.

<p>J. Schumpeter, Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy (New York; Harper, 1942), p. 175. Professor Schumpeter is, I believe, also the original author of the myth that Pareto and Barone have "solved" the problem of socialist calculation. What they, and many others, did was merely to state the conditions which a rational allocation of resources would have to satisfy and to point out that these were essentially the same as the conditions of equilibrium of a competitive market. This is something altogether different from knowing how the allocation of resources satisfying these conditions can be found in practice. Pareto himself (from whom Barone has taken practically everything he has to say), far from claiming to have solved the practical problem, in fact explicitly denies that it can be solved without the help of the market. See his Manuel d'économie pure (2d ed., 1927), pp. 233-34. The relevant passage is quoted in an English translation at the beginning of my article on "Socialist Calculation: The Competitive 'Solution,' " in Economica, New Series, Vol. VIII, No. 26 (May, 1940), p. 125.
