<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Philonous: </span>Good morning, Hylas: I didn&#8217;t expect to find you out and about so
early.
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hylas: </span>It is indeed somewhat unusual: but my thoughts were so taken up with a subject I
was talking about last night that I couldn&#8217;t sleep, so I decided to get up and walk in the
garden.
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>That&#8217;s good! It gives you a chance to see what innocent and agreeable pleasures you
lose every morning. Can there be a pleasanter time of the day, or a more delightful season
of the year? That purple sky, those wild but sweet notes of birds, the fragrant
bloom on the trees and flowers, the gentle influence of the rising sun, these and
a thousand nameless beauties of nature inspire the soul with secret raptures.
But I&#8217;m afraid I am interrupting your thoughts; for you seemed very intent on
something.
<!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Yes, I was, and I&#8217;d be grateful if you would allow me to carry on with it. But I don&#8217;t
in the least want to deprive myself of your company, for my thoughts always flow more
easily in conversation with a friend than when I am alone. Please, may I share with you
the thoughts I have been having?
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>With all my heart! It is what I would have requested myself, if you hadn&#8217;t asked
first.
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I was considering the odd fate of those men who have in all ages, through a desire to
mark themselves off from the common people or through heaven knows what trick of their
thought, claimed either to believe nothing at all or to believe the most extravagant things
in the world. This wouldn&#8217;t matter so much if their paradoxes and scepticism didn&#8217;t bring
consequences that are bad for mankind in general. But there&#8217;s a risk that they <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">will </span>do
that, and that when men who are thought to have spent their whole time in the pursuit of
knowledge claim to be entirely ignorant of everything, or advocate views that are in
conflict with plain and commonly accepted principles, this will tempt other
people&#8212;who have less leisure for this sort of thing&#8212;to become suspicious of
the most important truths, ones they had previously thought to be sacred and
unquestionable.
<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I entirely agree with you about the bad effects of the paraded doubts of some
philosophers and the fantastical views of others. I have felt this so strongly in recent
times that I have dropped some of the high-flown theories I had learned in their
universities, replacing them with ordinary common opinions. Since this revolt of mine
against metaphysical notions and in favour of the plain dictates of nature and
                                                                            
                                                                            
common sense, I swear that I find I can think ever so much better, so that I
can now easily understand many things which previously were mysteries and
riddles.
<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I am glad to find there was nothing in the accounts I heard of you.
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>What, if you please, were they?
<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>In last night&#8217;s conversation you were represented as someone who maintains the
most extravagant opinion that ever entered into the mind of man, namely that there is no
such thing as <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">material substance </span>in the world.
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I seriously believe that there is no such thing as what philosophers call &#8216;material
substance&#8217;; but if I were made to see anything absurd or sceptical in this, then I would
have the same reason to renounce this belief as I think I have now to reject the contrary
opinion.
<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>What! can anything be more fantastical, more in conflict with common sense, or
a more obvious piece of scepticism, than to believe there is no such thing as
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">matter</span>?
<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Steady on, Hylas! What if it were to turn out that you who hold that
there <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">is </span>matter are&#8212;by virtue of that opinion&#8212;a greater sceptic, and maintain
more paradoxes and conflicts with common sense, than I who believe no such
thing?
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>You have as good a chance of convincing me that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">the part is greater than the whole</span>
as of convincing me that I must give up my belief in matter if I am to avoid absurdity and
scepticism.
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Well then, are you content to accept as true any opinion that turns out to be the
most agreeable to common sense, and most remote from scepticism?
<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>With all my heart. Since you want to start arguments about the plainest things in
the world, I am content for once to hear what you have to say.
<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Tell me, please, Hylas: what do you mean by a &#8216;sceptic&#8217;?
<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I mean what everyone means, &#8216;someone who doubts everything&#8217;.
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So if someone has no doubts concerning some particular point, then with regard to
that point he cannot be thought a sceptic.
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I agree with you.
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Does doubting consist in accepting the affirmative or the negative side of a
question?
<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Neither. Anyone who understands English must know that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">doubting </span>signifies a
suspense between the two sides.
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So if someone <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">denies </span>any point, he can no more be said to <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">doubt </span>concerning it than
he who <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">affirms </span>it with the same degree of assurance.
<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>True.
<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And so his denial no more makes him a sceptic than the other is.
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I acknowledge it.
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Then how does it happen, Hylas, that you call me a sceptic because I deny what
you affirm, namely the existence of matter? For all you know, I may be as firmly
convinced in my denial as you are in your affirmation.
<!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Hold on a moment, Philonous. My definition of &#8216;sceptic&#8217; was wrong; but you can&#8217;t
hold a man to every false step he makes in conversation. I did say that a sceptic is
someone who doubts everything; but I should have added, &#8216;&#x2026;or who denies the reality and
truth of things&#8217;.
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>What things? Do you mean the principles and theorems of sciences? But these, you
know, are universal intellectual notions, and have nothing to do with <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">matter</span>, so that the
denial of matter doesn&#8217;t imply the denial of them.
<!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I agree about that. But what about other things? What do you think about
distrusting the senses, denying the real existence of sensible things, or claiming to know
nothing of them? Isn&#8217;t that enough to qualify a man as a sceptic? <span 
class="cmr-10">[</span><span 
class="cmr-9">Throughout the</span>
<span 
class="cmti-9">Dialogues</span><span 
class="cmr-9">, &#8216;sensible&#8217; means &#8216;capable of being sensed&#8217;&#8212;that is, visible or audible or tangible</span>
<span 
class="cmr-9">etc.</span><span 
class="cmr-10">]</span>
<!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Well, then, let us see which of us it is that denies the reality of sensible things, or
claims to have the greatest ignorance of them; since, if I understand you rightly, he is to
be counted the greater sceptic.
<!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>That is what I desire.<a 
 id="x1-2000doc"></a>
<!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>What do you mean by &#8216;sensible things&#8217;?
<!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Things that are perceived by the senses. Can you imagine that I mean anything
else?
<!--l. 81--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I&#8217;m sorry, but it may greatly shorten our enquiry if I have a clear grasp of your
notions. Bear with me, then, while I ask you this further question. Are things &#8216;perceived
by the senses&#8217; only the ones that are perceived <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">immediately</span>? Or do they include things
that are perceived <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">mediately</span>, that is, through the intervention of something
else?
<!--l. 83--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I don&#8217;t properly understand you.
<!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>In reading a book, what I <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">immediately </span>perceive are the letters <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>on the page<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>, but
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">mediately </span>or <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">by means of these </span>the notions of God, virtue, truth, etc. are suggested to my
mind. Now, there&#8217;s no doubt that <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>the letters are truly sensible things, or things
perceived by sense; but I want to know whether you take <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>the things suggested by them
to be &#8216;perceived by sense&#8217; too.
<!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>No, certainly, it would be absurd to think that God or virtue are sensible things,
though they may be signified and suggested to the mind by sensible marks with which
they have an arbitrary connection.
<!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>It seems then, that by &#8216;sensible things&#8217; you mean only those that can be perceived
immediately by sense.
<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Right.
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Doesn&#8217;t it follow from this that when I see one part of the sky red and another
blue, and I infer from this that there must be some cause for that difference
of colours, that cause cannot be said to be a &#8216;sensible thing&#8217; or perceived by
eyesight?
<!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It does.
<!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Similarly, when I hear a variety of sounds I cannot be said to hear their
causes.
<!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>You cannot.
<!--l. 101--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And when by touch I feel a thing to be hot and heavy, I can&#8217;t say with any truth or
correctness that I feel the cause of its heat or weight.
<!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>To head off any more questions of this kind, I tell you once and for all that by
&#8216;sensible things&#8217; I mean only things that are perceived by sense, and that the senses
perceive only what they perceive <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">immediately</span>; because they don&#8217;t make inferences. So the
deducing of causes or occasions from effects and appearances (which are the only things
we perceive by sense) is entirely the business of reason. <span 
class="cmr-10">[</span><span 
class="cmr-9">In this context, &#8216;occasion&#8217; can</span>
<span

<!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" ><span

sensible.

<!--l. 118--><p class="noindent" ><span

sensible qualities.

<!--l. 126--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Does the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">reality </span>of sensible things consist in being perceived? or is it something
different from their being perceived&#8212;something that doesn&#8217;t involve the mind?
<!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>To exist is one thing, and to be perceived is another.

perceived?

class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So if heat is granted to have a real existence, it must exist outside the
mind.
<!--l. 136--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It must.
<!--l. 138--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Tell me, Hylas, is this real existence equally possible for all degrees of heat that we
feel; or is there a reason why we should attribute it to some degrees of heat and not to
others? If there is, please tell me what it is.
<!--l. 140--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Whatever degree of heat we perceive by sense we can be sure exists also in the
object that occasions it.
<!--l. 142--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>What, the greatest as well as the least?
<!--l. 144--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Yes, because the same reason holds for both: they are both perceived by sense;
indeed, the greater degree of heat is more <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>intensely<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>sensibly perceived; so if there is any
difference it is that we are <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">more </span>certain of the real existence of a greater heat than we can
be of the reality of a lesser.
<!--l. 146--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But isn&#8217;t the most fierce and intense degree of heat a very great pain?
<!--l. 148--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>No-one can deny that.
<!--l. 150--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And can any unperceiving thing have pain or pleasure?
<!--l. 152--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Certainly not.
<!--l. 154--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Is your material substance a senseless thing or does it have sense and
perception?
<!--l. 156--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It is senseless, without doubt.
<!--l. 158--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So it can&#8217;t be the subject of pain.
<!--l. 160--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 162--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Nor, consequently, can it be the subject of the greatest heat perceived by sense,
since you agree that this is a considerable pain.
<!--l. 164--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I accept that.
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 166--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Then what are we to say about your external object? Is it a material substance, or
is it not?
<!--l. 168--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It is a material substance with the sensible qualities inhering in it.
<!--l. 170--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But then how can a great heat exist in it, since you agree it cannot exist in a
material substance? Please clear up this point.
<!--l. 172--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Hold on, Philonous! I&#8217;m afraid I went wrong in granting that intense heat is a pain.
I should have said not that the pain <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">is </span>the heat but that it is <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">the consequence or effect of</span>
the heat.
<!--l. 174--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>When you put your hand near the fire, do you feel one simple uniform sensation or
two distinct sensations?
<!--l. 176--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Just one simple sensation.
<!--l. 178--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Isn&#8217;t the heat immediately perceived?
<!--l. 180--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It is.
<!--l. 182--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And the pain?
<!--l. 184--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>True.
<!--l. 186--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Well, then, seeing that they are both immediately perceived at the same time, and
that the fire affects you with only one simple or uncompounded idea <span 
class="cmr-10">[</span><span 
class="cmr-9">= one idea without</span>
<span 
class="cmr-9">parts</span><span 
class="cmr-10">]</span>, it follows that this <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">one </span>simple idea is both the immediately perceived intense heat
and the pain; and consequently, that the immediately perceived intense heat is identical
with a particular sort of pain.
<!--l. 188--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It seems so.
<!--l. 190--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Consult your thoughts again, Hylas: can you conceive an intense sensation to occur
without pain or pleasure?
<!--l. 192--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I cannot.
<!--l. 194--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Or can you form an idea of sensible pain or pleasure <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">in general, </span>abstracted from
every <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">particular </span>idea of heat, cold, tastes, smells, etc.?
<!--l. 196--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I don&#8217;t find that I can.
<!--l. 198--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Then doesn&#8217;t it follow that sensible pain is nothing but intense degrees of those
sensations or ideas?
<!--l. 200--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>That is undeniable. In fact, I&#8217;m starting to suspect that a very great heat can&#8217;t exist
except in a mind perceiving it.
<!--l. 202--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>What! are you then in that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">sceptical </span>state of suspense, between affirming and
denying?
<!--l. 204--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I think I can be definite about it. A very violent and painful heat can&#8217;t exist outside
the mind.
<!--l. 206--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So according to you it has no real existence.
<!--l. 208--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I admit it.
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 210--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Is it certain, then, that no body in nature is really hot?
<!--l. 212--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I haven&#8217;t said that there is no real heat in bodies. I only say that there&#8217;s no such
thing as an intense real heat <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>in bodies<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>.
<!--l. 214--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But didn&#8217;t you say earlier that all degrees of heat are equally real, or
that if there <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">is </span>any difference the greater heat is more certainly real than the
lesser?
<!--l. 216--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Yes, I did; but that was because I had overlooked the reason there is for
distinguishing between them, which I now plainly see. It is this: because <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>intense heat is
nothing but a particular kind of painful sensation, and <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>pain can&#8217;t exist except in a
perceiving being, it follows that <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>no intense heat can really exist in an unperceiving
corporeal <span 
class="cmr-10">[</span><span 
class="cmr-9">= &#8216;bodily&#8217;</span><span 
class="cmr-10">] </span>substance. But that&#8217;s no reason for denying that less intense heat can
exist in such a substance.
<!--l. 218--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But how are we to draw the line separating degrees of heat that exist only in the
mind from ones that exist outside it?
<!--l. 220--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>That isn&#8217;t hard. The slightest pain can&#8217;t exist unperceived, as you know; so any
degree of heat that is a pain exists only in the mind. We don&#8217;t have to think the same for
degrees of heat that are not pains.
<!--l. 222--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I think you agreed a while back that no unperceiving being is capable of pleasure,
any more than it is of pain.
<!--l. 224--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I did.
<!--l. 226--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Well, isn&#8217;t warmth&#8212;a milder degree of heat than what causes discomfort or
worse&#8212;a pleasure?
<!--l. 228--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>What of it?
<!--l. 230--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>It follows that warmth can&#8217;t exist outside the mind in any unperceiving substance,
or body.
<!--l. 232--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>So it seems.
<!--l. 234--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>we have reached the position that<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>degrees of heat that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">aren&#8217;t </span>painful and
also ones that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">are </span>can exist only in a thinking substance! Can&#8217;t we conclude
from this that external bodies are absolutely incapable of any degree of heat
whatsoever?
<!--l. 236--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>On second thoughts, I am less sure that warmth is a pleasure than I am that intense
heat is a pain.
<!--l. 238--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I don&#8217;t claim that warmth is as <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>great a pleasure as heat is a pain. But if you admit
it to be even a <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>small pleasure, that is enough to yield my conclusion.
<!--l. 240--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I could rather call it &#8216;absence of pain&#8217;. It seems to be merely the lack of pain and of
pleasure. I hope you won&#8217;t deny that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">this </span>quality or state is one that an unthinking
substance can have!
<!--l. 242--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>If you are determined to maintain that warmth is not a pleasure, I don&#8217;t know how
to convince you otherwise except by appealing to your own experience. But what do you
think about cold?
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 244--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>The same as I do about heat. An intense degree of cold is a pain; for to feel a very
great cold is to experience a great discomfort, so it can&#8217;t exist outside the mind. But a
lesser degree of cold can exist outside the mind, as well as a lesser degree of
heat.
<!--l. 246--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So when we feel a moderate degree of heat (or cold) from a body that is applied to
our skin, we must conclude that that body has a moderate degree of heat (or cold) in
it?
<!--l. 248--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>We must.
<!--l. 250--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Can any doctrine be true if it necessarily leads to absurdity?
<!--l. 252--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Certainly not.
<!--l. 254--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Isn&#8217;t it an absurdity to think that a single thing should be at the same time both
cold and warm?
<!--l. 256--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It is.
<!--l. 258--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Well, now, suppose that one of your hands is hot and the other cold, and that they
are both at once plunged into a bowl of water that has a temperature between the two.
Won&#8217;t the water seem cold to one hand and warm to the other?
<!--l. 260--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It will.
<!--l. 262--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Then doesn&#8217;t it follow by your principles that the water really is both cold
and warm at the same time&#8212;thus believing something that you agree to be an
absurdity?
<!--l. 264--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I admit that that seems right.
<!--l. 266--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So the principles themselves are false, since you have admitted that no true
principle leads to an absurdity.
<!--l. 268--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>But, after all, can anything be more absurd than to say that there is no heat in the
fire?
<!--l. 270--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>To make the point still clearer, answer me this: in two cases that are exactly alike,
oughtn&#8217;t we to make the same judgment?
<!--l. 272--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>We ought.
<!--l. 274--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>When a pin pricks your finger, doesn&#8217;t it tear and divide the fibres of your
flesh?
<!--l. 276--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 278--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 282--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>You hold that the pin itself doesn&#8217;t contain either the sensation that it causes, or
anything like it. So, given what you have just agreed to&#8212;<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>namely that like cases should
be judged alike<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>&#8212;you ought to hold that the fire doesn&#8217;t contain either <span

<!--l. 284--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Well, since it must be so, I am content to give up this point, and admit that heat
and cold are only sensations existing in our minds. Still, there are plenty of other qualities
through which to secure the reality of external things.
<!--l. 286--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But what will you say, Hylas, if it turns out that the same argument applies with
regard to all other sensible qualities, and that none of them can be supposed to exist
outside the mind, any more than heat and cold can?
<!--l. 288--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Proving that would be quite a feat, but I see no chance of your doing
so.
<!--l. 290--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Let us examine the other sensible qualities in order. What about tastes? Do you
think they exist outside the mind, or not?
<!--l. 292--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Can anyone in his right mind doubt that sugar is sweet, or that wormwood is
bitter?
<!--l. 294--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Tell me, Hylas: is a sweet taste a particular kind of pleasure or pleasant sensation,
or is it not?
<!--l. 296--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It is.
<!--l. 298--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And isn&#8217;t bitterness some kind of discomfort or pain?
<!--l. 300--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I grant that.
<!--l. 302--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>If therefore sugar and wormwood are unthinking corporeal substances existing
outside the mind, how can sweetness and bitterness&#8212;that is, pleasure and pain&#8212;be in
them?
<!--l. 304--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Hold on, Philonous! Now I see what has deluded me all this time. You asked
whether heat and cold, sweetness and bitterness, are particular sorts of pleasure and pain;
to which I answered simply that they are. I should have answered by making a
distinction: those qualities <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">as perceived by us </span>are pleasures or pains, but <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">as existing in</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">the external objects </span>they are not. So we cannot conclude without qualification
that there is no heat in the fire or sweetness in the sugar, but only that heat or
sweetness <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">as perceived by us </span>are not in the fire or the sugar. What do you say to
this?
<!--l. 306--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I say it is irrelevant. We were talking only about &#8216;sensible things&#8217;, which you defined
as things we immediately perceive by our senses. Whatever <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">other </span>qualities you are
talking about have no place in our conversation, and I don&#8217;t know anything
about them. You may indeed claim to have discovered certain qualities that you
don&#8217;t perceive, and assert that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">they </span>exist in fire and sugar; but I can&#8217;t for the
life of me see how that serves your side in the argument we were having. Tell
me then once more, do you agree that heat and cold, sweetness and bitterness
(meaning the qualities that are perceived by the senses), don&#8217;t exist outside the
mind?
<!--l. 308--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I see it is no use holding out, so I give up the cause with respect to those four
qualities. Though I must say it sounds odd to say that sugar isn&#8217;t sweet.
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 310--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>It might sound better to you if you bear this in mind: someone whose palate is
diseased may experience as <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">bitter </span>stuff that at other times seems <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">sweet </span>to him. And it&#8217;s
perfectly obvious that different people perceive different tastes in the same food, since
what one man delights in another loathes. How could this be, if the taste were really
inherent in the food?
<!--l. 312--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I admit that I don&#8217;t know how.
<!--l. 314--><p class="noindent" ><span

tastes? Aren&#8217;t they just so many pleasing or displeasing sensations?

<!--l. 318--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Then can you conceive it to be possible that they should exist in an unperceiving
thing?
<!--l. 320--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I cannot.
<!--l. 322--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Or can you imagine that filth and excrement affect animals that choose to feed on
them with the same smells that we perceive in them?
<!--l. 324--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>By no means.
<!--l. 326--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Then can&#8217;t we conclude that smells, like the other qualities we have been
discussing, cannot exist anywhere but in a perceiving substance or mind?
<!--l. 328--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I think so.
<!--l. 330--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>What about sounds? Are they qualities really inherent in external bodies, or
not?
<!--l. 332--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>They don&#8217;t inhere in the sounding bodies. We know this, because when a bell is
struck in a vacuum, it sends out no sound. So the subject of sound must be the
air.
<!--l. 334--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Explain that, Hylas.
<!--l. 336--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>When the air is set into motion, we perceive a louder or softer sound in
proportion to the air&#8217;s motion; but when the air is still, we hear no sound at
all.
<!--l. 338--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Granting that we never hear a sound except when some motion is produced in the
air, I still don&#8217;t see how you can infer from this that the sound itself is in the
air.
<!--l. 340--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>This motion in the external air is what produces in the mind the sensation of sound.
By striking on the ear-drum it causes a vibration which is passed along the
auditory nerves to the brain, whereon the mind experiences the sensation called
sound.
<!--l. 342--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>What! is sound a sensation?
<!--l. 344--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>As I said: <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">as perceived by us </span>it is a particular sensation in the mind.
<!--l. 346--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And can any sensation exist outside the mind?
<!--l. 348--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>No, certainly.
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 350--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But if sound is a sensation, how can it exist in the air, if by &#8216;the air&#8217; you mean a
senseless substance existing outside the mind?
<!--l. 352--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Philonous, you must distinguish sound as it is perceived by us from sound as it is in
itself; or&#8212;in other words&#8212;distinguish the sound we immediately perceive from the sound
that exists outside us. The former is indeed a particular kind of sensation, but the latter
is merely a vibration in the air.
<!--l. 354--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I thought I had already flattened that distinction by the answer I gave when you
were applying it in a similar case before. But I&#8217;ll let that pass. Are you sure, then, that
sound is really nothing but motion?
<!--l. 356--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I am.
<!--l. 358--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Whatever is true of real sound, therefore, can truthfully be said of motion.
<!--l. 360--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It may.
<!--l. 362--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So it makes sense to speak of motion as something that is loud, sweet, piercing, or
low-pitched!
<!--l. 364--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I see you are determined not to understand me. Isn&#8217;t it obvious that those qualities
belong only to <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">sensible </span>sound, or &#8216;sound&#8217; in the ordinary everyday meaning of the word,
but not to &#8216;sound&#8217; in the real and scientific sense, which (as I have just explained) is
nothing but a certain motion of the air?
<!--l. 366--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>It seems, then, there are two sorts of sound&#8212;the common everyday sort that we
hear, and the scientific and real sort <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>that we don&#8217;t hear<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>.
<!--l. 368--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Just so.
<!--l. 370--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And the latter kind of sound consists in motion.
<!--l. 372--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>As I told you.
<!--l. 374--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Tell me, Hylas, which of the senses do you think the idea of motion belongs to? The
sense of hearing?
<!--l. 376--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Certainly not. To the senses of sight and touch.
<!--l. 378--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>It should follow then, according to you, that real sounds may possibly be seen or
felt, but can never be heard.
<!--l. 380--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Look, Philonous, make fun of my views if you want to, but that won&#8217;t alter the
truth of things. I admit that the inferences you draw from them sound a little odd; but
ordinary language is formed by ordinary people for their own use, so it&#8217;s not
surprising if statements that express exact scientific notions seem clumsy and
strange.
<!--l. 382--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Is it come to that? I assure you, I think I have scored a pretty big win when you so
casually depart from ordinary phrases and opinions; because what we were mainly
arguing about was whose notions are furthest from the common road and most in conflict
with what people in general think. Your claim that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">real sounds are never heard</span>, and that
we get our idea of sound through some other sense&#8212;can you think that this is merely an
odd-sounding scientific truth? Isn&#8217;t something in it contrary to nature and the truth of
things?
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 384--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Frankly, I don&#8217;t like it either. Given the concessions I have already made, I had
better admit that sounds also have no real existence outside the mind.
<!--l. 386--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And I hope you won&#8217;t stick at admitting the same of colours.
<!--l. 388--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Pardon me; the case of colours is very different. Can anything be more obvious than
the fact that we see colours <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">on </span>the objects?
<!--l. 390--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>The objects you speak of are, I suppose, corporeal substances existing outside the
mind.
<!--l. 392--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 394--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And they have true and real colours inhering in them?
<!--l. 396--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Each visible object has the colour that we see in it.
<!--l. 398--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 400--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>There is not.
<!--l. 402--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And do we perceive anything by our senses that we don&#8217;t perceive immediately?
<!--l. 404--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>How often do I have to say it? I tell you, we do not.
<!--l. 406--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Bear with me, Hylas, and tell me yet again whether anything is immediately
perceived by the senses other than sensible qualities. I know you asserted that nothing is;
but I want to know now whether you still think so.
<!--l. 408--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I do.
<!--l. 410--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Now, is your <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">corporeal substance </span>either a sensible quality or made up of sensible
qualities?
<!--l. 412--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>What a question to ask! Who ever thought it was?
<!--l. 414--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Here is why I ask. When you say that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">each visible object has the colour that we</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">see in it</span>, you imply that either <span 
class="cmbx-10">(1) </span>visible objects are sensible qualities, or else
<span 
class="cmbx-10">(2) </span>something other than sensible qualities can be perceived by sight. But we
earlier agreed that <span 
class="cmbx-10">(2) </span>is false, and you still think it is; <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>so we are left with the
thesis <span 
class="cmbx-10">(1) </span>that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">visible objects are sensible qualities</span><span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>. Now, in this conversation
you have been taking it that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">visible objects are corporeal substances</span>; and so we
reach the conclusion that your <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">corporeal substances are nothing but sensible</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">qualities</span>.
<!--l. 416--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>You may draw as many absurd consequences as you please, and try to entangle the
plainest things; but you will never persuade me out of my senses. I clearly understand my
own meaning.
<!--l. 418--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I wish you would make me understand it too! But since you don&#8217;t want me to look
into your notion of corporeal substance, I shall drop that point. But please tell me
whether the colours that we see are <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>the very ones that exist in external bodies or <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>some
other colours.
<!--l. 420--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>They are the very same ones.
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 422--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Oh! Then are the beautiful red and purple that we see on those clouds over there
really in them? Or do you <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>rather<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>think that the clouds in themselves are nothing but a
dark mist or vapour?
<!--l. 424--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I must admit, Philonous, that those colours aren&#8217;t really in the clouds as they seem
to be at this distance. They are only apparent colours.
<!--l. 426--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span><span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Apparent </span>call you them? How are we to distinguish these apparent colours from
real ones?
<!--l. 428--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Very easily. When a colour appears only at a distance, and vanishes when one comes
closer, it is merely apparent.
<!--l. 430--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And I suppose that real colours are ones that are revealed by looking carefully from
close up?
<!--l. 432--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Right.
<!--l. 434--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Does the closest and most careful way of looking use a microscope, or only the
naked eye?
<!--l. 436--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>A microscope, of course.
<!--l. 438--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But a microscope often reveals colours in an object different from those perceived
by unassisted sight. And if we had microscopes that could magnify to as much as we
liked, it is certain that no object whatsoever when seen through them would appear with
the same colour that it presents to the naked eye.
<!--l. 440--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Well, what do you conclude from that? You can&#8217;t argue that there are really and
naturally no colours on objects, just because we can contrive artificial ways to alter them
or make them vanish.
<!--l. 442--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>It can obviously be inferred from your own concessions, I think, that all the colours
we see with our naked eyes are only <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">apparent</span>&#8212;like those on the clouds&#8212;since they vanish
when one looks more closely and accurately, as one can with a microscope. And to
anticipate your next objection I ask you whether the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">real and natural </span>state of an
object is revealed better by a very sharp and piercing sight, or by one that is less
sharp.
<!--l. 444--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>By the former, without doubt.
<!--l. 446--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Isn&#8217;t it plain from <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>the science of<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>optics that microscopes make the sight more
penetrating, and represent objects as they would appear to the eye if it were naturally
endowed with extreme sharpness?
<!--l. 448--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It is.
<!--l. 450--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So the microscopic representation of a thing should be regarded as the one that
best displays the thing&#8217;s real nature, or what the thing is in itself. so the colours perceived
through a microscope are more genuine and real than those perceived in any other
way.
<!--l. 452--><p class="noindent" >&#x00A0;<span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I admit that there&#8217;s something in what you say.
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 454--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Besides, it&#8217;s not only <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">possible </span>but clearly <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">true </span>that there actually are animals whose
eyes are naturally formed to perceive things that are too small for us to see. What do you
think about those inconceivably small animals that we perceive through microscopes?
Must we suppose they are all totally blind? If they can see, don&#8217;t we have to suppose that
their sight has the same use in preserving their bodies from injuries as eyesight does in all
other animals? If it does have that use, isn&#8217;t it obvious that they must see particles that
are smaller than their own bodies, which will present them with a vastly different
view of each object from the view that strikes our senses? Even our own eyes
don&#8217;t always represent objects to us in the same way. Everyone knows that
to someone suffering from jaundice all things seem yellow. So isn&#8217;t it highly
probable that animals whose eyes we see to be differently structured from ours,
and whose bodily fluids are unlike ours, don&#8217;t see the same colours as we do in
every object From all of this, shouldn&#8217;t it seem to follow that all colours are
equally <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>apparent, and that none of the ones that we see are <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>really in any outer
object?
<!--l. 456--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It should.
<!--l. 458--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>To put it past all doubt, consider the following. If colours were real properties or
qualities inhering in external bodies, they couldn&#8217;t be altered except by some alteration in
the very bodies themselves: but isn&#8217;t it evident that the colours of an object can be
changed or made to disappear entirely through the use of a microscope, or some change
in the fluids in the eye, or a change in the viewing distance, without any sort
of real alteration in the thing itself? Indeed, even when all the other factors
remain unaltered some objects present different colours to the eye depending
on the angle from which they are looked at. The same thing happens when
we view an object in different brightnesses of light. And everyone knows that
the same bodies appear differently coloured by candle-light from what they do
in daylight. Add to these facts our experience of a prism, which separates the
different rays of light and thereby alters the colour of an object, causing the
whitest object to appear deep blue or red to the naked eye. <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Now </span>tell me whether
you still think that each body has its true, real colour inhering in it. If you
think it has, I want to know what <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>particular distance and orientation of the
object, what <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>special condition of the eye, what <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>intensity or kind of light is
needed for discovering that true colour and distinguishing it from the apparent
ones.
<!--l. 460--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I admit to being quite convinced that they are all equally apparent, that
no such thing as colour really inheres in external bodies, and that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">colour is</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">wholly in the light</span>. What confirms me in this opinion is the fact that colours are
more or less vivid depending on the brightness of the light, and that when there
is no light no colours are seen. Furthermore, if there were colours in external
objects, how could we possibly perceive them? No external body affects the
mind unless it acts first on our sense-organs; and the only action of bodies is
motion, and this can&#8217;t be communicated except in <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">collisions</span>. So a <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">distant </span>object
can&#8217;t act on the eye, and so can&#8217;t enable itself or its properties to be perceived
by the mind. From this it plainly follows that what immediately causes the
perception of colours is some substance that is <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">in contact with </span>the eye&#8212;such as
                                                                            
                                                                            
light.
<!--l. 462--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>What? Is light a substance?
<!--l. 464--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I tell you, Philonous, external light is simply a thin fluid substance whose tiny
particles, when agitated with a brisk motion and in various ways reflected to the eyes
from the different surfaces of outer objects, cause different motions in the optic nerves;
these motions are passed along to the brain, where they cause various states
and events; and these are accompanied by the sensations of red, blue, yellow,
etc.
<!--l. 466--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>It seems, then, that all the light does is to shake the optic nerves.
<!--l. 468--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>That is all.
<!--l. 470--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And as a result of each particular motion of the nerves the mind is affected with a
sensation, which is some particular colour.
<!--l. 472--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Right.
<!--l. 474--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And these sensations have no existence outside the mind.
<!--l. 476--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 478--><p class="noindent" ><span

whether it is wise for you, in a discussion like this one, to affirm that the red and blue we
see <span

sounds, tastes&#8212;in a word, all that are termed &#8216;secondary qualities&#8217;&#8212;have no
existence outside the mind. But in granting this I don&#8217;t take anything away
from the reality of matter or external objects, because various philosophers
maintain what I just did about secondary qualities and yet are the far from
denying matter. <span

this clearer: philosophers divide sensible qualities into <span

<span

qualities that aren&#8217;t primary; and the philosophers assert that these are merely
sensations or ideas existing nowhere but in the mind. No doubt you are already
aware of all this. For my part, I have long known that such an opinion was
current among philosophers, but I was never thoroughly convinced of its truth till

general reasoning that covers all the other sensible qualities <span

extension? If you agree that no idea or anything like an idea can exist in an

imagining&#8212;can be really inherent in matter. Whether the sensible quality is
shape or sound or colour or what you will, it seems impossible that any of these
should subsist in something that doesn&#8217;t perceive it. (Not to mention the peculiar
difficulty there must be in conceiving a material substance, prior to and distinct
from extension, to be the <span

proceed next to <span

very swift and very slow?
<!--l. 560--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 562--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 566--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 570--><p class="noindent" ><span

the time that it seems to you to take. (<span

make the point just as well.) That is to say, according to your view that both of the
perceived motions are in the object, a single body can really move both very swiftly and
very slowly at the same time. How is this consistent either with common sense or with
what you recently agreed to?
<!--l. 576--><p class="noindent" ><span

class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Now for <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">solidity</span>: If you don&#8217;t use &#8216;solidity&#8217; to name any sensible quality, then
it is irrelevant to our enquiry. If you <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">do </span>use it to name a sensible quality, the
quality must be either <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">hardness </span>or <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">resistance</span>. But each of these is plainly relative
to our senses: it is obvious that what seems hard to one animal may appear
soft to another that has greater force and firmness of limbs; and it is equally
obvious that the resistance I feel <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>when I press against a body<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>is not in the
body.
<!--l. 580--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I agree that the sensation of resistance, which is all you immediately perceive, is not
in the body; but the cause of that sensation is.
<!--l. 582--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But the causes of our sensations aren&#8217;t immediately perceived, and therefore aren&#8217;t
sensible. I thought we had settled this point.
<!--l. 584--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I admit that we did. Excuse me if I seem a little embarrassed; I am having trouble
quitting my earlier views.
<!--l. 586--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>It may be a help for you to consider this point: once extendedness is admitted to
have no existence outside the mind, the same <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">must </span>be granted for motion, solidity, and
gravity, since obviously they all presuppose extendedness. So it is superfluous to enquire
into each of them separately; in denying extendedness, you have denied them all to have
any real existence.
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 588--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>If this is right, Philonous, I wonder why the philosophers who deny the secondary
qualities any real existence should yet attribute it to the primary qualities. If there&#8217;s no
difference between them, how can this be accounted for?
<!--l. 590--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>It isn&#8217;t my business to account for every opinion of the philosophers! But there are
many possible explanations, one of them being that <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>those philosophers were
influenced by the fact that<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>pleasure and pain are associated with the secondary
qualities rather than with the primary ones. Heat and cold, tastes and smells, have
something more vividly pleasing or disagreeable than what we get from the
ideas of extendedness, shape, and motion. And since it is too visibly absurd to
hold that pain or pleasure can be in an unperceiving substance, men have more
easily been weaned from believing in the external existence of the secondary
qualities than of the primary ones. You will see that there is something in this if
you recall the distinction <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">you </span>made between moderate heat and intense heat,
allowing one a real existence <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>outside the mind<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>while denying it to the other. But
after all, there is no rational basis for that distinction; for surely a sensation
that is neither pleasing nor painful is just as much <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">a sensation </span>as one that is
pleasing or painful; so neither kind should be supposed to exist in an unthinking
subject.
<!--l. 592--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It has just come into my head, Philonous, that I have somewhere heard of a
distinction between absolute and sensible extendedness. Granted that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">large </span>and <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">small</span>
consist merely in the relation other extended things have to the parts of our own bodies,
and so aren&#8217;t really in the substances themselves; still, we don&#8217;t have to say the
same about <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">absolute extendedness, </span>which is something abstracted from large and
small, from this or that particular size and shape. Similarly with motion: <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">fast</span>
and <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">slow </span>are altogether relative to the succession of ideas in our own minds.
But just because those special cases of motion do not exist outside the mind, it
doesn&#8217;t follow that the same is true of the absolute motion that is abstracted from
them.
<!--l. 594--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>What distinguishes one instance of motion, or of extendedness, from another? Isn&#8217;t
it something <span

are stripped of all <span

way.

<!--l. 608--><p class="noindent" ><span

you are able to form this or that idea in your mind. Now I&#8217;m willing to let our
present dispute be settled in the following way. If you can form in your thoughts a
distinct abstract idea of motion or extendedness, having none of those sensible
qualities&#8212;swift and slow, large and small, round and square, and the like&#8212;which we
agree exist only in the mind, then I&#8217;ll capitulate. But if you can&#8217;t, it will be

class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Can you even separate the ideas of extendedness and motion from the ideas of all
the so-called secondary qualities?
<!--l. 616--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>What! isn&#8217;t it easy to consider extendedness and motion by themselves,
abstracted from all other sensible qualities? Isn&#8217;t that how the mathematicians handle
them?
<!--l. 618--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I acknowledge, Hylas, that it is not difficult to form general propositions and
reasonings about extendedness and motion, without mentioning any other qualities, and
in that sense to treat them abstractedly. I can pronounce the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">word </span>&#8216;motion&#8217; by itself, but
how does it follow from this that I can form in my mind the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">idea </span>of motion without an
idea of body? Theorems about extension and shapes can be proved without any <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">mention</span>
of large or small or any other sensible quality, but how does it follow from this
that the mind can form and grasp an abstract <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">idea </span>of extension, without any
particular size or shape or <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>other<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>sensible quality? Mathematicians study <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">quantity</span>,
disregarding any other sensible qualities that go with it on the grounds that they are
irrelevant to the proofs. But when they lay aside the words and contemplate
the bare ideas, I think you&#8217;ll find that they aren&#8217;t the pure abstracted ideas of
extendedness.
<!--l. 620--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>But what do you say about <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">pure intellect</span>? Can&#8217;t abstracted ideas be formed by that
faculty?
<!--l. 622--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Since I can&#8217;t form abstract ideas at all, it is clearly impossible for me to form them
with help from &#8216;pure intellect&#8217;, whatever faculty you mean that phrase to refer to. Setting
aside questions about the nature of pure intellect and its spiritual objects such as virtue,
reason, God, etc., I can say this much that seems clearly true: sensible things can only be
perceived by the senses or represented by the imagination; so shape and size don&#8217;t
belong to pure intellect because they are initially perceived through the senses.
If you want to be surer about this, try and see if you can frame the idea of
any shape, abstracted from all particularities of size and from other sensible
qualities.
<!--l. 624--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Let me think a little&#8212;I don&#8217;t find that I can.
<!--l. 626--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Well, can you think it possible that something might really exist in nature when it
implies a contradiction in its conception?
<!--l. 628--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>By no means.
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 630--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Therefore, since even the mind can&#8217;t possibly separate the ideas of <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>extendedness
and motion from <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>all other sensible qualities, doesn&#8217;t it follow that where <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>the former
exist <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>the latter must also exist?
<!--l. 632--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It would seem so.
<!--l. 634--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Consequently the very same arguments that you agreed to be decisive against the
<span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>secondary qualities need no extra help to count just as strongly against the <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>primary
qualities also. Besides, if you trust your senses don&#8217;t they convince you that all sensible
qualities co-exist, that is, that they all appear to the senses as being in the same place?
Do your senses ever represent a motion or shape as being divested of all other visible and
tangible qualities?
<!--l. 636--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>You needn&#8217;t say any more about this. I freely admit&#8212;unless there has been some
hidden error or oversight in our discussion up to here&#8212;that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">all </span>sensible qualities should
alike be denied existence outside the mind. But I fear that I may have been too free in my
former concessions, or overlooked some fallacy in your line of argument. In short, I didn&#8217;t
take time to think.
<!--l. 638--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>As to that, Hylas, take all the time you want to go back over our discussion. You
are at liberty to repair any slips you have made, or to support your initial opinion by
presenting arguments that you have so far overlooked.
<!--l. 640--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I think it was a big oversight on my part that I failed to distinguish sufficiently the
<span

class="cmti-10x-x-109">sensation</span>. The sensation cannot exist outside the mind, but it doesn&#8217;t
follow that the object cannot either.
<!--l. 642--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>What object do you mean? The object of the senses?
<!--l. 644--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Exactly.
<!--l. 646--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So it is immediately perceived?
<!--l. 648--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 650--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Explain to me the difference between <span

class="cmti-10x-x-109">a</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">sensation</span>.
<!--l. 652--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I take the sensation to be an <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">act </span>of the perceiving mind; beside which, there is
something perceived, which I call the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">object </span><span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>of the act<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>. For example, there is red and
yellow on that tulip, but the act of perceiving those colours is in me only, and not in the
tulip.
<!--l. 654--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>What tulip are you talking about? Is it the one that you see?
<!--l. 656--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>The same.
<!--l. 658--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And what do you see beside colour, shape, and extendedness?
<!--l. 660--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Nothing.
<!--l. 662--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So you would say that the red and yellow are co-existent with the extension,
wouldn&#8217;t you?
<!--l. 664--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span><span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>Yes, and<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>I go further: I say that they have a real existence outside the mind in
some unthinking substance.
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 666--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>That the colours are really in the tulip which I see, is obvious. Nor can it be denied
that this tulip may exist independently of your mind or mine; but that any immediate
object of the senses&#8212;that is, any idea or combination of ideas&#8212;should exist in an
unthinking substance, or exterior to all minds, is in itself an obvious contradiction. Nor
can I imagine how it follows from what you said just now, namely that the red and
yellow are in <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">the tulip you saw</span>, since you don&#8217;t claim to <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">see that unthinking</span>
<span

<!--l. 668--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>You are skillful at changing the subject, Philonous.
<!--l. 670--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I see that you don&#8217;t want me to push on in that direction. So let&#8217;s return to your
distinction between sensation and object. If I understand you correctly, you hold that in
every perception there are two things of which one is an action of the mind and the other
is not.
<!--l. 672--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>True.
<!--l. 674--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And this action can&#8217;t exist in or belong to any unthinking thing; but whatever else
is involved in a perception may do so.
<!--l. 676--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>That is my position.
<!--l. 678--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So that if there <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">were </span>a perception without any act of the mind, that perception
could exist in an unthinking substance.
<!--l. 680--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I grant that. But it is impossible that there should be such a perception.
<!--l. 682--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>When is the mind said to be active?
<!--l. 684--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>When it produces, puts an end to, or changes anything.
<!--l. 686--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Can the mind produce, discontinue, or change anything in any way except by an

<!--l. 688--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It cannot.
<!--l. 690--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So the mind is to count as being active in its perceptions to the extent that

<!--l. 692--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It is.

<span

<!--l. 696--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 698--><p class="noindent" ><span

rather than otherwise is an effect of my volition. But this isn&#8217;t smelling either; for if it
were, I would smell every time I breathed in that manner.
<!--l. 700--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 702--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Smelling, then, is a <span

in<span

<!--l. 706--><p class="noindent" ><span

than the plucking, holding up, and breathing in<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>. Whatever else happens&#8212;including my
perceiving a smell&#8212;is independent of my will, and I am wholly passive with respect to it.
Is it different in your case, Hylas?
<!--l. 708--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>No, it&#8217;s just the same.
<!--l. 710--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 714--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But does it similarly depend on your will that when you look at this flower you
perceive white rather than some other colour? When you direct your open eyes towards
that part of the sky, can you avoid seeing the sun? Or is light or darkness the effect of
your volition?
<!--l. 716--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 726--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Well, then, since in the actual perception of light and colours you are altogether

sensation? And doesn&#8217;t it follow from your own concessions that the perception of light
and colours&#8212;which doesn&#8217;t involve any action&#8212;can exist in an unperceiving substance?
And isn&#8217;t this a plain contradiction?
<!--l. 728--><p class="noindent" ><span

aren&#8217;t light and colours, tastes, sounds, etc. all equally passions or sensations in the mind?
You may <span

conceive how a sensation could exist in an unperceiving substance. But when on the other
hand I look in a different way at <span

<!--l. 774--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Consequently every bodily substance, being the substratum of extendedness, must
have in itself another extendedness which qualifies it to be a substratum, <span

extendedness must also have something spread under it, a sub-substratum, so to speak<span

and so on to infinity. Isn&#8217;t this absurd in itself, as well as conflicting with what you have
just said, namely that the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">substratum </span>was something distinct from extendedness and not
including it?
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 776--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Yes, but Philonous you misunderstand me. I don&#8217;t mean that matter is &#8216;spread&#8217; in a
crude literal sense under extension. The word &#8216;substratum&#8217; is used only to express in
general the same thing as &#8216;substance&#8217;.
<!--l. 778--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Well, then, let us examine the relation implied in the term &#8216;substance&#8217;. Is it not the
relation of <span

<!--l. 780--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 782--><p class="noindent" ><span

another?

<!--l. 786--><p class="noindent" ><span

one?
<!--l. 788--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 790--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I don&#8217;t want to force any meaning onto your words; you are free to explain them as
you please. But please make me understand <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">something </span>by them! You tell me that
matter supports or stands under accidents. How? As your legs support your
body?

<!--l. 796--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I don&#8217;t know what to say. I once thought I understood well enough what
was meant by matter&#8217;s &#8216;supporting&#8217; qualities. But now the more I think about
it the <span

it.
<!--l. 798--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So it seems that you have no idea at all, either positive or relative, of matter. You
don&#8217;t know what it is in itself, or what relation it has to qualities.
<!--l. 800--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 802--><p class="noindent" ><span

conceiving at the same time a material support for them.

<!--l. 806--><p class="noindent" ><span

also conceive something that you can&#8217;t conceive!
<!--l. 808--><p class="noindent" ><span

try this: It has just occurred to me that we were both led into error by your
treating each quality by itself. I grant that no quality can exist on its own outside
the mind; colour can&#8217;t exist without extension, nor can shape exist without
some other sensible quality. But as a number of qualities united or blended
together <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">constitute </span>an entire sensible thing, there is no obstacle to supposing
that such things&#8212;<span

<!--l. 814--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>It&#8217;s true that existing-in-isolation did come up in our discussion<span

motion, we concluded they couldn&#8217;t exist outside the mind because it was impossible even
in thought to separate them from all secondary qualities, so as to conceive them existing
by themselves. But this wasn&#8217;t the only argument I used on that occasion. However, if
you like we can set aside our whole conversation up to here, counting it as nothing. I
am willing to let our whole debate be settled as follows: If you can conceive
it to be possible for any mixture or combination of qualities, or any sensible
object whatever, to exist outside the mind, then I will grant it actually to be
so.
<!--l. 816--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>By that test, the point will soon be decided. What is easier than to conceive a tree

conceive them existing in that way right now.

unconceived?
<!--l. 824--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It is.
<!--l. 826--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>The tree or house therefore which you think of is conceived by you.

<!--l. 830--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 832--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 834--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Then what led you to say that you conceived a house or tree existing independently
and out of all minds whatsoever?
<!--l. 836--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>That was an oversight, I admit; but give me a moment to think about what
led me into it. It was&#8212;<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>I now realize, after reflection<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>&#8212;an amusing mistake.
As I was thinking of a tree in a solitary place with nobody there to see it, I
thought that was conceiving a tree as existing unperceived or unthought of,
                                                                            
                                                                            
overlooking the fact I myself conceived it all the while. But now I plainly see
that all I can do is to form ideas in my own mind. I can conceive in my own
thoughts the idea of a tree, or a house, or a mountain, but that is all. And this
is far from proving that I can conceive them existing out of the minds of all
spirits.
<!--l. 838--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>You agree, then, that you can&#8217;t conceive how any corporeal sensible thing should
exist otherwise than in a mind.

<!--l. 842--><p class="noindent" ><span

conceive.
<!--l. 844--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I admit that I don&#8217;t know what to think, but I still have doubts. Isn&#8217;t it certain that
I see things at a distance? Don&#8217;t we perceive the stars and moon, for example, to be a
long way away? Isn&#8217;t this, I say, obvious to the senses?
<!--l. 846--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Don&#8217;t you in dreams also perceive objects like those?
<!--l. 848--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I do.
<!--l. 850--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And don&#8217;t they then appear in the same way to be distant?
<!--l. 852--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 854--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But do you conclude that the apparitions in a dream are outside the mind?
<!--l. 856--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>By no means.
<!--l. 858--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Then you ought not to conclude that sensible objects <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>seen when you are awake<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>are
outside the mind, from their appearance or the manner in which you perceive
them.
<!--l. 860--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I admit that. But doesn&#8217;t my <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>visual<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>sense deceive me in those cases, <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>by telling me
that sensible objects are at a distance when really they are not<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>?
<!--l. 862--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>By no means. Neither eyesight nor reason inform you that the idea or thing that
you immediately perceive actually exists outside the mind. By eyesight you know only
that you are affected with certain sensations of light and colours, etc. And you won&#8217;t say
that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">these </span>are outside the mind.
<!--l. 864--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>True; but all the same, don&#8217;t you think that eyesight makes some suggestion of
outerness or distance?
<!--l. 866--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>When you approach a distant object, do the visible size and shape keep changing,
or do they appear the same at all distances?
<!--l. 868--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>They are in a continual change.
<!--l. 870--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So sight doesn&#8217;t &#8216;suggest&#8217; or in any way inform you that the visible object you
immediately perceive exists at a distance, or that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">it </span>will be perceived when you move
further forward; because there is a continued <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">series </span>of visible objects succeeding each
other during the whole time of your approach.
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 872--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I agree about that: but still I know, on seeing an object, what object I shall see <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">after</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">I have gone a certain distance</span>&#8212;never mind whether it is exactly the same object or not.
So something about <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">distance </span>is still being suggested.
<!--l. 874--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>My dear Hylas, just think about that a little, and then tell me whether there is
anything more to it that this: From the ideas that you actually perceive by sight you have
by experience learned to infer (in accordance with the general rules of nature) what
other ideas you will experience after such and such a succession of time and
motion.
<!--l. 876--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Upon the whole, I think that&#8217;s what it comes down to.
<!--l. 878--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Isn&#8217;t it obvious that if a man born blind were suddenly enabled to see, he would
start with no experience of what may be suggested by sight?
<!--l. 880--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It is.
<!--l. 882--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So he would not, according to you, have any notion of <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">distance </span>linked to the things
he saw. He would take the latter to be a new set of sensations existing only in his
mind.
<!--l. 884--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>That is undeniable.
<!--l. 886--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But to make it still more plain: isn&#8217;t distance a line running out from the
eye?
<!--l. 888--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It is.
<!--l. 890--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Can a line so situated be perceived by sight?
<!--l. 892--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It cannot.
<!--l. 894--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So doesn&#8217;t it follow that distance isn&#8217;t strictly and immediately perceived by
sight?
<!--l. 896--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It seems so.
<!--l. 898--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Again, do you think that colours are at a distance?
<!--l. 900--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I have to acknowledge that they are only in the mind.
<!--l. 902--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But don&#8217;t colours appear to the eye as coexisting at the same place as extension
and shape
<!--l. 904--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 906--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Then how can you conclude from <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>the deliverances of<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>sight that shapes <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>do exist
outside the mind, when you agree that colours <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>don&#8217;t? The sensible appearances of both
are the very same.
<!--l. 908--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I don&#8217;t know what to answer.
<!--l. 910--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Even if distance <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">were </span>truly and immediately perceived by the mind, it still wouldn&#8217;t
follow that it existed out of the mind. For whatever is immediately perceived is an idea;
and can any idea exist out of the mind?
<!--l. 912--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It would be absurd to suppose so. But tell me, Philonous, can we perceive or know
nothing except our ideas?
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 914--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Set aside <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>what we may know through<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>the rational deducing of causes from effects;
that is irrelevant to our enquiry. As for the senses: you are the best judge of whether you
<span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>perceive anything that you don&#8217;t <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>immediately perceive. And I ask you, are the things
you immediately perceive anything but your own sensations or ideas? In the course
of this conversation you have more than once declared yourself on those two
points; this latest question of yours seems to indicate that you have changed your
mind.
<!--l. 916--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>To tell you the truth, Philonous, I think there are two kinds of objects: one kind
perceived immediately, and called &#8216;ideas&#8217;; the other kind are real things or external
objects perceived by the mediation of ideas, which resemble and represent them. Now I
grant that ideas don&#8217;t exist outside the mind; but the second sort of objects do. I am
sorry I didn&#8217;t think of this distinction sooner; it would probably have cut short your
discourse.
<!--l. 918--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Are those external objects perceived by <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>sense, or by <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>some other faculty?
<!--l. 920--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>They are perceived by sense.
<!--l. 922--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>What? Is there anything perceived by sense that isn&#8217;t immediately perceived?
<!--l. 924--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Yes, Philonous, there is&#8212;in a way. For example, when I look at a picture or statue
of Julius Caesar, I may be said to perceive him in a fashion (though not immediately) by
my senses.
<!--l. 926--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>You seem to hold, then, that our ideas, which are all that we immediately perceive,
are pictures of external things; and that the latter are also perceived by sense because
they have a conformity or resemblance to our ideas.
<!--l. 928--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>That is my meaning.
<!--l. 930--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And in the same way that Julius Caesar, in himself invisible, is nevertheless
perceived by sight, so also real things, in themselves imperceptible, are perceived by
sense.
<!--l. 932--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>In the very same way.
<!--l. 934--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Tell me, Hylas, when you look at the picture of Julius Caesar, do you see with your
eyes anything more than some colours and shapes, with a certain symmetry and
composition of the whole?

class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Nothing else.
<!--l. 938--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And wouldn&#8217;t a man who had never known anything about Julius Caesar see as
much?
<!--l. 940--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>He would.
<!--l. 942--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So he has his sight, and the use of it, as perfectly as you have yours.
<!--l. 944--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 946--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Then why are your thoughts directed to the Roman emperor while his are not?
This can&#8217;t come from the sensations or ideas of sense that you perceive at that moment,
for you have agreed that you have in that respect no advantage over the man who has
never heard of Julius Caesar. So it seems that the direction of your thoughts comes from
reason and memory&#8212;doesn&#8217;t it?

<!--l. 950--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So that example of yours doesn&#8217;t show that anything is perceived by sense
that isn&#8217;t immediately perceived. I don&#8217;t deny that we can be said in a certain
sense to perceive sensible things <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">mediately </span>by sense: that is when the immediate
perception of ideas by one sense suggests to the mind others, perhaps belonging
to another sense, of a kind that have often been perceived to go with ideas of
the former kind. For instance, when I hear a coach drive along the streets, all
that I immediately perceive is the sound; but from my past experience that
such a sound is connected with a coach, I am said to &#8216;hear the coach&#8217;. Still,
it is obvious that in truth and strictness <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">nothing can be heard but sound</span>; and
the coach in that example is not strictly perceived by sense but only suggested
from experience. Similarly, when we are said to see a red-hot bar of iron; the
solidity and heat of the iron are not the objects of sight, but are suggested to the
imagination by the colour and shape that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">are </span>strictly perceived by that sense. In
short,  <dl class="list1"><dt class="list">

       <!--l. 951--><p class="noindent" >the only things that are <span

<!--l. 952--><p class="noindent" >As for other things, clearly they are only <span

class="tcrm-1200">· </span>Caesar&#8217;s picture:
obviously, if you keep to this you&#8217;ll have to hold that the real things that our
ideas copy are perceived not by sense but by some internal faculty of the soul
such as <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>reason or <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>memory. I would be interested to know what arguments
<span

me.
<!--l. 956--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>All I want is to learn from you how to come by knowledge of material things.
Whatever we perceive is perceived either immediately by sense, or mediately by reason
and reflection. But you have excluded sense; so please show me what reason you have to
believe in their existence, or what means you can possibly adopt to prove, to my
understanding or your own, that they exist.
<!--l. 958--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>To be perfectly frank, Philonous, now that I think about it I can&#8217;t find
any good reason for my position. But it seems pretty clear that it&#8217;s at least
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">possible </span>that such things really exist; and as long as there is no absurdity in
supposing them, I shall continue in my belief until you bring good reasons to the
contrary.
<!--l. 960--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>What? Has it come to this, that you believe in the existence of material objects,
                                                                            
                                                                            
and that this belief is based on the mere <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">possibility </span>of its being true? Then you challenge
me to bring reasons against it; though some people would think that the burden of proof
lies with him who holds the affirmative position. Anyway, this very thesis that you are
now determined to maintain without any reason is in effect one that you have&#8212;more than
once during this conversation&#8212;seen good reason to give up. But let us set all that
aside. If I understand you rightly, you say our ideas <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">don&#8217;t </span>exist outside the mind,
but that they are copies, likenesses, or representations of certain originals that
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">do</span>.
<!--l. 962--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>You have me right.
<!--l. 964--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Our ideas, then, are <span

<!--l. 966--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>They are.
<!--l. 968--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Do those external things have a stable and permanent nature independently of our
senses; or do they keep changing as we move our bodies and do things with our faculties
or organs of sense?
<!--l. 970--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Real things, obviously, have a fixed and real nature which remains the
same through any changes in our senses or in how our bodies are placed or
how they move. Such changes may indeed affect the ideas in our minds, but it
would be absurd to think they had the same effect on things existing outside the
mind.
<!--l. 972--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>How, then, can things that are perpetually fleeting and variable as our ideas are be
copies or likenesses of any thing that is fixed and constant? Since all <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">sensible</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">qualities</span>&#8212;size, shape, colour, etc.&#8212;that is, our <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">ideas</span>, are continually changing with every
alteration in the distance, medium, or instruments of sensation, how can any fixed
material object be properly represented or depicted by several distinct things <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>or ideas<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>,
each of which is so unlike the others? Or if you say that the object resembles
just one of our ideas, how can we distinguish that true copy from all the false
ones?
<!--l. 974--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I have to admit, Philonous, that I am at a loss. I don&#8217;t know what to say to
this.
<!--l. 976--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>There is more. Are material objects in themselves perceptible or imperceptible?
<!--l. 978--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Properly and immediately nothing can be perceived but ideas. All material things,
therefore, are in themselves insensible, and can be perceived only through ideas of
them.
<!--l. 980--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Ideas are sensible, then, and their originals&#8212;the things they are copies of&#8212;are
insensible?
<!--l. 982--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Right.
<!--l. 984--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But how can something that is sensible be <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">like </span>something that is insensible? Can a
real thing, in itself invisible, be like a colour? Can a real thing that isn&#8217;t audible be like a
sound? In a word, can anything be like a sensation or idea but another sensation or
idea?
<!--l. 986--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I must admit that I think not.
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 988--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Can there possibly be any doubt about this? Don&#8217;t you perfectly know your own
ideas?
<!--l. 990--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Yes, I know them perfectly; for something that I don&#8217;t perceive or know can&#8217;t be
any part of my idea.
<!--l. 992--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Well, then, examine your ideas, and then tell me if there&#8217;s anything in them that
could exist outside the mind, or if you can conceive anything <span

the mind.
<!--l. 994--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Upon looking into it I find that I can&#8217;t conceive or understand how anything but an
idea can be like an idea. And it is most evident that no idea can exist outside the
mind.
<!--l. 996--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So you&#8217;re forced by your own principles to deny the reality of sensible things,
because you made it consist in an absolute existence outside the mind. That is to say, you
are a downright sceptic. So I have met my target, which was to show that your principles
lead to scepticism.
<!--l. 998--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>For the present I am, if not entirely convinced, at least silenced.
<!--l. 1000--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I wonder what more you would require in order to be perfectly convinced. Haven&#8217;t
you been free to explain yourself in any way you liked? Were any little conversational slips
held against you? Weren&#8217;t you allowed to retract or reinforce anything you had previously
said, as best served your purpose? Hasn&#8217;t everything you could say been heard and
examined with all the fairness imaginable? In a word, haven&#8217;t you on every
point been convinced out of your own mouth? And if you can now discover
any flaw in any of your former concessions, or think of any remaining tactic,
any new distinction, shading, or comment whatsoever, why don&#8217;t you produce
it?
<!--l. 1002--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>A little patience, Philonous. I am at present so bewildered to see myself entangled,
and as it were imprisoned in the labyrinths you have led me into, that I can&#8217;t be expected
to find my way out on the spur of the moment. You must give me time to look around
me, and recollect myself.
<!--l. 1004--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Listen&#8212;isn&#8217;t that the college-bell? Let us go in, and meet here again tomorrow
morning. In the mean time you can think about this morning&#8217;s conversation,
and see if you can find any fallacy in it, or invent any new means to extricate
yourself.
<!--l. 1006--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Agreed.

<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hylas: </span>I beg your pardon, Philonous, for not meeting you sooner. All this morning my
head was so filled with our recent conversation that I didn&#8217;t notice the time of the day, or
indeed anything else!
<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Philonous: </span>I am glad you were so focussed on it. I hope that if there were any mistakes
in your concessions, or fallacies in my reasonings from them, you will now show them to
me.
<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I assure you, ever since I saw you I have done nothing but search for mistakes and
fallacies, and with that in mind I have examined in detail the whole course of yesterday&#8217;s
conversation. But it has all been useless; for the views I was led into in the
conversation seemed even clearer and more obvious when I reviewed them today;
and the more I think about them the more irresistibly they force my assent to
them.
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Don&#8217;t you think that this is a sign that they are genuine, and that they proceed
from nature and are in accordance with right reason? Truth and beauty have this in
common: they both show to advantage when looked at closely and carefully. The false
glitter of error and heavy make-up can&#8217;t endure being looked at for too long or from too
close up!
<!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I admit there is a great deal in what you say. And I am as convinced as anyone
could be of the truth of those strange consequences <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>that you argued for yesterday<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>, so
long as I keep in mind the reasonings that lead to them. But when those arguments are
out of my thoughts, <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>my mind goes the other way<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>; there seems to be something so
satisfactory, natural and intelligible in the modern way of explaining things that I confess
that I don&#8217;t know how to reject it.
<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I don&#8217;t know what way you mean.
<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>How does it do that?
<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It is supposed that <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>the mind resides in some part of the brain, from which
the nerves originate, spreading out from there to all parts of the body; that
<span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>outer objects act in different ways on the sense-organs, starting up certain
vibrations in the nerves; that <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>the nerves pass these vibrations along to the
brain (where the mind is located); and that <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>the mind is variously affected with
ideas according to the various impressions or traces the vibrations make in the
brain.
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And call you this an explanation of how we are affected with ideas?
<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" ><span

According to it, certain traces in the brain are the causes or occasions of our ideas. <span

thing?
<!--l. 32--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>What else do you think I could possibly mean?
<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Sensible things are all immediately perceivable; and things that are immediately
perceivable are ideas; and these exist only in the mind. This much, if I am not mistaken,
you have long since agreed to.
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I don&#8217;t deny it.
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So the brain that you speak of, being a sensible thing, exists only in the
mind! I would like to know whether you think it reasonable to suppose that one
idea or thing existing in the mind occasions all the other ideas. And if you do
think this, how do you account for the origin of that primary idea or &#8216;brain&#8217;
itself?
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I don&#8217;t explain the origin of our ideas by the brain which is perceivable to <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>sense,
because it is <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>as you say<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>only a combination of sensible ideas. I am talking about another
brain, which I <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>imagine.
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But aren&#8217;t imagined things just as much in the mind as perceived things
are?
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I must admit that they are.
<!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>So the difference <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>between perceiving and imagining<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>isn&#8217;t important. You have
been accounting for ideas by certain motions or impressions in the brain, that is, by
some alterations in an <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">idea</span>&#8212;and it doesn&#8217;t matter whether it is <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>sensible or
<span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>imaginable.
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I begin to suspect my hypothesis.
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Apart from spirits, our own ideas are the only things we know or conceive. So when
you say that all ideas are occasioned by impressions in the brain, do you conceive this
brain or not? If you do, then you talk of ideas imprinted on an idea, causing that same
idea, which is absurd. If you don&#8217;t conceive it, you talk unintelligibly instead of forming a
reasonable hypothesis.
<!--l. 52--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I can now see clearly that it was a mere dream. There is nothing in it.
<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>It&#8217;s no great loss; for, after all, this way of &#8216;explaining&#8217; things (as you called it)
could never have satisfied any reasonable man. What connection is there between a
<span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>vibration in the nerves and <span

dress with the seasons? How aptly the elements are disposed! What variety and
usefulness even in the lowest things that nature produces! What delicacy, what
beauty, what complexity of organization in the bodies of animals and plants! How
finely all things are suited to their particular ends and also to their roles as
appropriate parts of the whole! And while they mutually aid and support, don&#8217;t they
also display each other in a better light? Raise now your thoughts from this

laws by which the unseen Author of nature runs the universe. How vivid and
radiant is the shine of the fixed stars! How magnificent and rich the careless
profusion with which they seem to be scattered throughout the whole vault of

some other mind in which they exist. As sure as the sensible world really exists,

it.

<!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >This provides you with a direct and immediate proof, from a most evident premise, of the
existence of a God. Theologians and philosophers had proved beyond all controversy, from
the beauty and usefulness of the various parts of the creation, that it was the
workmanship of God. But some of us have the advantage that we can prove the existence
of an infinite mind from <span

from astronomy and natural philosophy and without bringing in facts about
<span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>how wonderfully the parts of the world relate to one another. What gives us
this advantage is just the simple thought that the sensible world is what we
perceive by our various senses, that nothing is perceived by the senses except ideas,
and that no idea and no thing of which an idea is a copy can exist otherwise
than in a mind. <span

the most strenuous advocate for atheism, without any laborious search into

arguments. This single reflection on impossibility that the visible world or any part of
it&#8212;even the most low-grade and shapeless part of it&#8212;should exist outside a
mind is enough to overthrow the whole system of atheism. It destroys those
miserable refuges <span

chaos, or a confused jumble of atoms&#8212;how <span

imaginable&#8212;can exist independently of a mind; and he need go no further to be
convinced of his folly. Can anything be fairer than to let the disagreement be
settled by the outcome of such a test, leaving it to the atheist himself to see if he
can conceive, even <span

material things so as to perceive them in themselves, but that it perceives them through
its union with the substance of God. Because that is a spiritual substance, it is purely
intelligible, that is, capable of being the immediate object of a <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>human<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>mind&#8217;s thought.
Furthermore, God&#8217;s essence contains perfections corresponding to each created thing, and
this correspondence enables those perfections to represent created things to the <span

This hypothesis is open to many other obvious objections, but I shall only add
that in making a created world exist otherwise than in the mind of a spirit, the
hypothesis <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>of Malebranche<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>is liable to all the absurdities of the more usual
views. Added to which it has a special absurdity all its own, namely that it
makes the material world serve no purpose. If it is valid to argue against other
hypotheses in the sciences that they suppose nature or the Divine Wisdom to make
something for no purpose, or to employ tedious round-about methods to get a result
which could have been achieved much more easily and swiftly, what are we to
think of this hypothesis which supposes that the whole world was made for no
purpose?
<!--l. 92--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>But don&#8217;t you also hold that we see all things in God? If I&#8217;m not mistaken, your

<!--l. 94--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Few men think, but all insist on having opinions, which is why men&#8217;s opinions are
superficial and confused. It isn&#8217;t surprising that doctrines which in themselves are ever so
different should nevertheless be confused with one another by people who don&#8217;t think
hard about them. So I shan&#8217;t be surprised if some men imagine that I run into the wild
fantasies of Malebranche, though in truth I am very remote from them. He builds
on the most abstract general ideas, which I entirely disclaim. He asserts an
absolute external world, which I deny. He maintains that we are deceived by
our senses, and don&#8217;t know the real natures or the true forms and shapes of
extended things; of all which I hold the direct contrary! So that over-all there
are no principles more fundamentally opposite than his and mine. I have to
say that I entirely agree with what the Holy Scripture says, that &#8216;in God we
live and move and have our being&#8217;. But I am far from believing that we &#8216;see
things in his essence&#8217; in the manner you have presented. Here is my view, in a

perceive countless ideas, and by an act of my will can form a great variety of them,
raising them up in my imagination. (Though I have to say that these creatures of my
imagination are not as distinct, strong, vivid, and permanent as are the ones
I perceive through my senses, which latter are called &#8216;real things&#8217;.) From all
this I conclude that there is a mind that affects me every moment with all the
sensible impressions I perceive. And from the variety, order, and manner of these
impressions I conclude that the author of them is wise, powerful, and good,
beyond anything I can comprehend. Please get this straight: I do <span

class="tcrm-1200">·</span>as
Malebranche does<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>&#8212;that I see things by perceiving something that represents them
in the intelligible essence of God. I don&#8217;t <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>even<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>understand that. What I say
is this: the things I perceive are known by the understanding, and produced
by the will, of an infinite Spirit. Isn&#8217;t all this very plain and evident? Is there
anything more in it than what a little observation of our own minds and what
happens in them not only enables us to conceive but also obliges us to assent
to?

we not admit a subordinate and limited cause of our ideas? In a word, may there not for

extended) substance existing outside the mind. What! have you already forgotten what
you were convinced of? Do you want me to repeat everything I have said about this?
Really, this isn&#8217;t arguing fairly, still to assume the existence of something that you have so
often admitted not to exist. But letting that go, I ask Aren&#8217;t all your ideas perfectly
passive and inert, including no kind of action in them?

class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I agree with you. And indeed it is obvious that when I move my finger it remains
passive; but my will that produced the motion is active.

action, you can conceive any action other than volition; in the second place
<span

<span

unreasonable to suppose that our ideas have any efficient or active cause other than
spirit.

<!--l. 160--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 162--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Hold on, Philonous! When I tell you that matter is an &#8216;instrument&#8217;, I don&#8217;t mean
absolutely nothing. Admittedly I don&#8217;t know what the particular kind of instrument
it is; but still I have some notion of <span

it.
<!--l. 164--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But what if it should turn out that even the most general notion of <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">instrument</span>,
understood as meaning something distinct from <span

use of an instrument inconsistent with the divine attributes?
<!--l. 166--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 168--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span><span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>I shall now do so<span

instrument?
<!--l. 170--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>The general notion is made up of what is common to all particular instruments.
<!--l. 172--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Don&#8217;t all instruments have this in common: they are used only in doing things that
can&#8217;t be performed by the mere act of our wills? Thus, for instance, I never use an
instrument to move my finger, because it is done by a volition. But I would use an
                                                                            
                                                                            
instrument if I wanted to remove part of a rock or tear up a tree by the roots.
Do you agree with this? Or can you show any example where an instrument
is used in producing an effect which immediately depends on the will of the
agent?
<!--l. 174--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I admit that I can&#8217;t.
<!--l. 176--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Well, then, how can you suppose that an all-perfect Spirit, on whose will all things
absolutely and immediately depend, would need an instrument in his operations, or that
he would use one if he didn&#8217;t need it? Thus, it seems to me, you have to admit that it
would be incompatible with the infinite perfection of God for him to use a lifeless inactive
instrument <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>such as <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">matter </span>is supposed to be<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>. That is, your own statements oblige you to
give up the point.
<!--l. 178--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>No answer to that comes readily to mind.
<!--l. 180--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span><span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>There is an answer that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">should </span>come to your mind<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>. You should be ready to admit
to the truth when it has been fairly proved to you. <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>I shall state the proof again<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>. We
<span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>beings whose powers are finite are forced to make use of instruments. And
the use of an instrument shows that the agent is limited by rules that were
prescribed by someone else <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>and not by him<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>, and that he cannot get what he wants
except in such-and-such a way and in such-and-such conditions. This seems
clearly to imply that the <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>supreme unlimited agent uses no tool or instrument
at all. An omnipotent Spirit has only to <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">will </span>that something happen and it
happens, straight off, without the use of any <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">means</span>. When <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>means are employed
by inferior agents <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>like you and me<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>, it isn&#8217;t because of any real causal power
that is in <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>them, any necessary fitness to produce the desired effect. Rather,
it is to comply with the laws of nature, or those conditions prescribed to us
by <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>God<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>, the first cause, who is himself above all limitation or prescription
whatsoever.

<!--l. 186--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>As to the first point: by &#8216;occasion&#8217; I mean an inactive, unthinking being, at the
presence of which God causes ideas in our minds.

doubts and produce a complete mental assent? However clear the light is in which
a visible object is set, it won&#8217;t be distinctly seen if there is any imperfection
in the vision or if the eye is not directed towards it. And however solid and
clearly presented a demonstration is, yet if there is also prejudice or wrong bias
in the understanding, can it be expected all at once to see the truth clearly
and adhere to it firmly? No! For that to happen, time and effort are needed;
the attention must be awakened and held by frequent repetition of the same
thing&#8212;often in the same light, often in different lights. I have said it already, and
                                                                            
                                                                            
find I must still repeat it to get you to accept it: when you claim to accept
you don&#8217;t know what, for you don&#8217;t know what reason, and for you don&#8217;t know
what purpose, you are taking extraordinary liberties. Can this be parallelled
in any art or science, any sect or profession of men? Or is there anything so
shamelessly groundless and unreasonable to be met with even in the lowest of common
conversation? But you persist in saying &#8216;Matter may exist&#8217;, without knowing
what you mean by &#8216;matter&#8217; or what you mean by saying that it &#8216;exists&#8217;. What
makes this especially surprising is the fact that it&#8217;s something you have just
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">decided </span>to say; you aren&#8217;t led to it by any reasons at all; for I challenge you
to show me something in nature that needs matter to explain or account for
it.
<!--l. 274--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>The reality of things can&#8217;t be maintained without supposing the existence of
matter. Don&#8217;t you think this is a good reason why I should be earnest in its
defence?
<!--l. 276--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>The reality of things! What things, sensible or intelligible?
<!--l. 278--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 280--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 282--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 284--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Let us fix on one particular thing. Isn&#8217;t it a sufficient evidence to me of the
existence of this glove that I see it and feel it and wear it? And if it isn&#8217;t, how <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">could </span>I be
assured of the reality of this thing, which I actually see in this place, by supposing
that some unknown thing which I never did or can see exists in an unknown
manner, in an unknown place, or in no place at all? How can the supposed reality
of something intangible be a proof that anything tangible really exists? Or of
something invisible that any visible thing really exists? Put generally: how can the
supposed reality of something imperceptible be a proof of the existence of a
perceptible thing? Explain this and I shall think that nothing is too hard for
you!
<!--l. 286--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Over-all I am content to admit that the existence of matter is highly improbable;
but I don&#8217;t see that it is directly and absolutely impossible.
<!--l. 288--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Even if matter is granted to be possible, <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">that </span>doesn&#8217;t give it a claim to existence,
any more than a golden mountain or a centaur, <span

<!--l. 290--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I admit that; but still you don&#8217;t deny that it is possible; and something that is
possible may, for all you know, actually exist.
<!--l. 292--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">do </span>deny it to be possible; and I think I have proved that it isn&#8217;t, from premises
that you have conceded. In the ordinary sense of the word &#8216;matter&#8217;, is anything more
implied than an extended, solid, shaped, movable substance, existing outside the mind?
And haven&#8217;t you admitted over and over that you&#8217;ve seen evident reason for denying the
possibility of such a substance?
<!--l. 294--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>True, but that is only one sense of the term &#8216;matter&#8217;.
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 296--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But isn&#8217;t it the only proper, genuine, commonly accepted sense? And if matter in
such a sense is proved impossible, may it not be thought with good grounds to be
absolutely impossible? Otherwise how could <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">anything </span>be proved impossible? Indeed, how
could there be any proof at all, of anything, to a man who feels free to unsettle and
change the common meanings of words?
<!--l. 298--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I thought philosophers might be allowed to speak more accurately than
common people do, and were not always confined to the common meaning of a
term.
<!--l. 300--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But the meaning I have stated is the common accepted sense <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">among philosophers</span>.
Anyway, setting that point aside, haven&#8217;t I let you take &#8216;matter&#8217; in whatever sense you
pleased? And haven&#8217;t you used this privilege to the utmost extent, sometimes entirely
changing the meaning, at others leaving out or putting into the definition of &#8216;matter&#8217;
whatever at that moment best served your purposes, contrary to all the known rules of
reason and logic? And hasn&#8217;t this shifting, unfair method of yours spun out our dispute to
an unnecessary length, matter having been scrutinised in each particular one of those
senses and, by your own admission, refuted in each of them? And can any more be
required to <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>prove the absolute impossibility of a thing than <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>to prove it to
be impossible in every particular sense that you or anyone else understands it
in?
<!--l. 302--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I am not so thoroughly satisfied that you have proved the impossibility of matter in
the last most obscure, abstracted and indefinite sense.
<!--l. 304--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>When is a thing shown to be impossible?
<!--l. 306--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>When an inconsistency is demonstrated between the ideas contained in its
definition.
<!--l. 308--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But where there are no ideas, no contradiction between ideas can be demonstrated.
<!--l. 310--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I agree with you.
<!--l. 312--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Now, consider the sense of the word &#8216;matter&#8217; that you have just called
obscure and indefinite: by your own admission it is obvious that this includes no
idea at all, no sense&#8212;except an unknown sense, which is the same thing as
none. So you can&#8217;t expect me to prove an inconsistency between ideas where
there are no ideas, or to prove the impossibility of &#8216;matter&#8217; taken in an unknown
sense, that is, in no sense at all. I aimed only to show that you meant nothing;
and I got you to admit that. So that in all your various senses you have been
shown to mean nothing at all, or if something then an absurdity. If this isn&#8217;t
sufficient to prove the impossibility of a thing, I wish you would tell me what
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">is</span>.
<!--l. 314--><p class="noindent" >&#x00A0;<span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I admit that you have proved that matter is impossible; nor do I see what else can
be said in defence of it. But when I give up matter I come to suspect all my other
notions. For surely none could be more seemingly evident than this once was;
yet it now seems as false and absurd as it previously seemed true. But I think
we have discussed the point enough for the present. I would like to spend the
rest of today running over in my thoughts the various parts of this morning&#8217;s

opinion?
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hylas: </span>Truly my opinion is that all our opinions are equally useless and uncertain. What
we approve today we condemn tomorrow. We make a fuss about knowledge, and spend
our lives in the pursuit of it, yet all the time, alas! we know nothing; and I don&#8217;t think
we <span

few. Nature certainly never intended us for speculation <span

<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>You may indeed know that fire appears hot, and water fluid; but that is merely
knowing what sensations are produced in your own mind when fire or water is applied to
your sense-organs. You are utterly in the dark as to their internal constitution, their true
and real nature.
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Don&#8217;t I know that this is a real stone that I&#8217;m standing on, and that what I see

class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span><span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Know? </span>No, it is impossible that you or any man alive should know it. All you <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">know</span>
is that you have such and such an idea or appearance in your own mind. But what does
that have to do with the real tree or stone? I tell you, the colour, shape, and hardness
that you perceive aren&#8217;t the real natures of those things, or in the least like them. The
same may be said of all other real things or corporeal substances that make up the world.
None of them has in itself anything like the sensible qualities that we perceive. So we
shouldn&#8217;t claim to affirm or know anything about them as they are in their own
nature.
<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>But surely, Hylas, I can distinguish gold, for example, from iron. How could I do
that if I didn&#8217;t know what either truly was?
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Believe me, Philonous, you can only distinguish between your own ideas. That
yellowness, that weight, and other sensible qualities&#8212;do you think that they are really in

forced to admit that such an existence means either a direct contradiction or
nothing at all, it follows that you are obliged to pull down your own hypothesis

I have the common man&#8217;s frame of mind; I am simple enough to believe my
senses and to leave things as I find them. Here&#8217;s what I think, in plain words.
The real things are the very things I see and feel and perceive by my senses. I
know these; and because I find that they satisfy all the needs and purposes of
life, I have no reason to worry about any other unknown beings. A piece of
sensible <span 
class="cmr-10">[</span><span 
class="cmr-9">= &#8216;perceptible&#8217;</span><span 
class="cmr-10">] </span>bread, for instance, would appease my hunger better than
ten thousand times as much of that insensible, unintelligible, &#8216;real&#8217; bread you
speak of. It is also my opinion that colours and other sensible qualities are in
the objects. I can&#8217;t for the life of me help thinking that snow is white, and fire
hot. You indeed, who by &#8216;snow&#8217; and &#8216;fire&#8217; mean certain external, unperceived,
unperceiving substances, are right to deny whiteness or heat to be qualities
inherent in them. But I, who understand by &#8216;snow&#8217; and &#8216;fire&#8217; the things I see and
feel, am obliged to think as other folk do. And as I am no sceptic about <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>the
nature of things, I am not a sceptic either about <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>their existence. That a thing
should be really perceived by my senses, and at the same time not really exist,
is to me a plain contradiction; since I cannot abstract, even in thought, the
<span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>existence of a sensible thing from <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>its being perceived. Wood, stones, fire, water,
flesh, iron, and other such things that I name and talk about are things that I
know. And I wouldn&#8217;t have known them if I hadn&#8217;t perceived them by my senses;

Away, then, with all that scepticism, all those ridiculous philosophical doubts! What a
joke is it for a philosopher to question the existence of sensible things until it is proved to
him from the truthfulness of God, or to claim that our knowledge about this falls short of
the knowledge we have of things that are obviously self-evident or rigorously proved. I
might as well doubt my own existence as the existence of the things that I actually see

our ideas are. Still, even though I have no idea of myself because I am a spirit or thinking
substance, <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">I know that I exist</span>. I know this, indeed, as certainly as I know that my ideas
exist. I also know what I mean by the terms &#8216;I&#8217; and &#8216;myself&#8217;; and I know this immediately
or intuitively, though I don&#8217;t perceive it as I perceive a triangle, a colour or a sound. The
mind (spirit, soul) is the indivisible and unextended thing that thinks, acts and
perceives. It is indivisible because it is unextended; and it is unextended because the
only extended, shaped, movable things are ideas; and something that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">perceives</span>
ideas, and that thinks and wills, clearly can&#8217;t itself <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">be </span>an idea. Ideas are inactive
things that are perceived: and spirits are things of a totally different sort. So I
deny that my soul is an idea, or like an idea. However, my soul can be said
to furnish me with an &#8216;idea&#8217; of God in a broad sense of the word &#8216;idea&#8217;&#8212;that
is, an image or likeness of God, though indeed an extremely inadequate one.
I get my notion of God by reflecting on my own soul, heightening its powers
and removing its imperfections. <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>My basic thought of God, therefore, is the
thought of &#8216;a thing that is <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">like me </span>except&#x2026;&#8217; and so on<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>. So although I have no
<span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>inert idea of God in my mind, I do have in myself a kind of <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>active image of
him <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>because I myself <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">am </span>an image = likeness of him<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>. And though I don&#8217;t
perceive him by sense, still I have a <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">notion </span>of him, which is to say that I know
him by reflection and reasoning. I immediately know my own mind and my
own ideas; and these give me, in an indirect way, a grasp of the possibility that
other spirits and ideas exist. Further, from the fact that I exist and the fact that
I find that my ideas <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>of sense<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>aren&#8217;t caused by me, I reason my way to the
unavoidable conclusion that a God exists and that all created things exist in his mind.
So much for your first question. By this time you can probably answer your
second question for yourself. <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>I have shown that there are four different ways in
which things can come before the mind, and none of them is a way in which
matter could come before your mind<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>. <span 
class="cmbx-10">(i) </span>You don&#8217;t perceive matter by mentally
representing it, as you do an inactive being or idea; <span 
class="cmbx-10">(ii) </span>nor do you know it,
as you know yourself, by an act of mentally attending to yourself. <span 
class="cmbx-10">(iii) </span>You
don&#8217;t understand it indirectly, through a resemblance between it and either
your ideas or yourself; and <span 
class="cmbx-10">(iv) </span>you don&#8217;t bring it into your mind by reasoning
from what you know immediately. All of this makes the case of matter widely
different from that of God, <span

<!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" >&#x00A0;<span

class="tcrm-1200">·</span>My answer falls into three parts<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>. <span 
class="cmbx-10">(1) </span>I don&#8217;t deny the existence of material
substance merely because I have no notion of it, but because the notion of it is
inconsistent&#8212;to have a notion of it would involve a self-contradiction. For all I know to
the contrary, there may exist many things of which none of us has or can have any idea or
notion whatsoever. But such things must be possible, i.e.&#x00A0;nothing inconsistent must be
included in their definition. <span 
class="cmbx-10">(2) </span>Although we believe in the existence of some things that
we don&#8217;t perceive, we oughtn&#8217;t to believe that any particular thing exists without some
reason for thinking so; but I have no reason for believing in the existence of matter. I
have no immediate intuition of it; and I can&#8217;t infer it&#8212;rigorously or even by
probable inference&#8212;from my sensations, ideas, notions, actions or passions. In
contrast with this, I undeniably know by reflection the existence of myself, that
is, my own soul, mind, or source of thought. You will forgive me if I repeat
the same things in answer to the same objections. The notion or definition of
<span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>material substance includes an obvious inconsistency, and that is not so for the
notion of <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>spirit. That ideas should exist in something that doesn&#8217;t perceive, or
be produced by something that doesn&#8217;t act, is inconsistent. But there is no
inconsistency in saying that a perceiving thing is the subject of ideas, or that an
active thing causes them. I concede that the existence of other finite spirits is
not immediately evident to us, nor have we any way of rigorously proving it;
but that doesn&#8217;t put such spirits on a level with material substances, <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>because
there are the following three differences<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>. <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>It is inconsistent to suppose there is
matter, but not to suppose there are finite spirits; <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>there is no argument for
matter, while there are probable reasons in favour of spirits; <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>there are no signs or
symptoms that make it reasonable to believe in matter, but we see signs and effects
indicating that there are other finite agents like ourselves. <span 
class="cmbx-10">(3) </span>Although I don&#8217;t
have an idea of spirit, if &#8216;idea&#8217; is used strictly, I do have a notion of it. I don&#8217;t
perceive it as an idea, or by means of an idea, but I know it by reflection <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>on
myself<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>.
<!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Despite all that you have said, it seems to me that according to your own
way of thinking, and by your own principles, you should conclude that you are
only a system of floating ideas without any substance to support them. Words

latter.

that a colour cannot perceive a sound, nor a sound a colour; and therefore that
I am one individual thing, distinct from colour and sound and (for the same
reason) distinct from all other sensible things and inert ideas. But I am not in the
same way conscious of either the existence or the essence of matter. On the
contrary, I know that nothing inconsistent can exist, and that the existence
of matter implies an inconsistency. Furthermore, I know what I mean when I
assert that there is a spiritual substance or support of ideas, that is, that a spirit
                                                                            
                                                                            
knows and perceives ideas. But I don&#8217;t know what people mean when they say
that an unperceiving substance contains and supports either ideas or items of
which ideas are copies. So there is no significant likeness between spirit and
matter.

my view. Ask the gardener why he thinks that cherry tree over there exists in the garden,
and he will tell you, because he sees and feels it&#8212;in short, because he perceives it by his
senses. Ask him why he thinks there is no orange-tree there, and he will tell you, because
he doesn&#8217;t perceive one. When he perceives something by sense, he terms it a real
thing and says that it exists; and anything that isn&#8217;t perceivable he says doesn&#8217;t
exist.
<!--l. 98--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Yes, Philonous, I agree that the existence of a sensible thing consists in being
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">perceivable</span>, but not in being <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">actually perceived</span>.
<!--l. 101--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And what is perceivable but an idea? And can an idea exist without being actually
perceived? These are points long since agreed between us.
<!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>However true your view is, you must admit that it is shocking, and contrary to the
common sense of men. Ask your gardener whether that tree has an existence out of his
mind; what answer do you think he would give you?
<!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>The same answer that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">I </span>would give, namely, that it does exist out of his mind. But
then surely to a Christian it can&#8217;t be shocking to say that the real tree existing outside
his mind is truly known and comprehended by (that is, exists in) the infinite mind of
God. Probably the gardener won&#8217;t at first glance be aware of the direct and immediate
proof there is of this&#8212;namely that the very existence of a tree or any other
perceptible thing implies a mind that contains it. But the point itself is one that he
can&#8217;t deny. What is at issue between the materialists and me is not whether
things have a real existence outside the mind of this or that person, but whether
they exist outside <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">all </span>minds, having an existence that doesn&#8217;t involve being
perceived by God. Some heathens and philosophers have indeed affirmed this, but
anyone whose notions of God are appropriate to the holy scriptures will think
differently
<!--l. 107--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>But how, according to your views, do real things differ from chimeras formed by the
imagination or the visions of a dream, since <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>according to you<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>they are all equally in the
mind?
<!--l. 109--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>The ideas formed by the imagination are faint and indistinct; also, they are entirely
dependent on the will. But the ideas perceived by sense&#8212;that is, real things&#8212;are more
vivid and clear, and they don&#8217;t in that way depend on our will, because they are
imprinted on our mind by a spirit other than us. So there&#8217;s no danger of mixing up
these <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>real things<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>with the foregoing <span

equally little danger of failing to distinguish them from the visions of a dream,
which are dim, irregular, and confused. And even if dreams were very lively and
natural, they could easily be distinguished from realities by their not being
coherently connected with the preceding and subsequent episodes of our lives, In
short, whatever method you use to distinguish <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">things </span>from <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">chimeras </span>is obviously
available to me too. For any such method must, I presume, be based on some
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">perceived </span>difference, and I don&#8217;t want to deprive you of any one thing that you
perceive.
<!--l. 111--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>But still, Philonous, you hold that there is nothing in the world but spirits and
ideas. You must admit that this sounds very odd.
<!--l. 113--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I agree that the word &#8216;idea&#8217;, not being commonly used for &#8216;thing&#8217;, sounds a little
peculiar. I used it because it implies a necessary relation to the mind; and it is now
commonly used by philosophers to stand for the immediate objects of the understanding.
But however odd the proposition may sound in words, there&#8217;s nothing very strange or
shocking in what it means, which in effect amounts merely to this: that <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>there are
only perceiving things and perceived things; or that <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>every unthinking being is
necessarily&#8212;from the very nature of its existence&#8212;perceived by some mind, if not by any
finite created mind then certainly by the infinite mind of God, in whom &#8216;we live, and
move, and have our being&#8217;. Is this as strange as to say that sensible qualities aren&#8217;t in the
objects? Or that we can&#8217;t be sure of the existence of things, or know anything of
their real natures, although we see and feel them and perceive them by all our
senses?
<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Don&#8217;t we have to infer from this that there are no such things as physical or
corporeal causes, but that a spirit is the immediate cause of all the phenomena in nature?
Can there be anything more extravagant than this?
<!--l. 117--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Yes, there can! It is infinitely more extravagant to say that an <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">inert </span>thing <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">operates</span>
on the mind, and an <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">unperceiving </span>thing causes our <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">perceptions</span>. Anyway, the
view that you for some reason find so extravagant is no more than the holy
scriptures assert in a hundred places. In them God is represented as the sole
and immediate cause of all those effects that some heathens and philosophers
customarily attribute to nature, matter, fate, or some such unthinking agent. There is
no need for me to support this with particular citations&#8212;scripture is full of
it.
<!--l. 119--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>You aren&#8217;t aware, Philonous, that in making God the immediate cause of all the
motions in nature you make him the author of murder, sacrilege, adultery, and the like
heinous sins.
<!--l. 121--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>In answer to that, I remark first that a person&#8217;s guilt is the same whether he
performs an action with or without an instrument. So if you think that God acts through
the mediation of an instrument or &#8216;occasion&#8217; called <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">matter</span>, you make him the author of
sin just as much as I do through my view that he is <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">immediate </span>agent in all those
operations that common people ascribe to &#8216;nature&#8217;. I further remark that sin or
wickedness does not consist in the outward physical action or movement, but in
something internal&#8212;the will&#8217;s departing from the laws of reason and religion. This is
clearly so, from the fact that killing an enemy in a battle or putting a criminal
                                                                            
                                                                            
legally to death is not thought sinful, although the outward acts are exactly
the same as in murder. Sin therefore doesn&#8217;t consist in the physical action, so
making God an immediate cause of all such actions isn&#8217;t making him the author
of sin. Lastly, I have nowhere said that God is the only agent who produces
all the motions in bodies. True, I have denied there are any agents other than
spirits; but this is quite consistent with assigning to thinking, rational beings the
use of limited powers in the production of motions. These powers are indeed
ultimately derived from God, but they are immediately under the direction of the
beings&#8217; own wills, and that is sufficient to entitle them to all the guilt of their
actions.
<!--l. 123--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>But denying matter, Philonous, or corporeal substance! There is the <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>sticking<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>point.
You can never persuade me that this isn&#8217;t in conflict with the universal sense of mankind.
If our dispute were to be settled by majority vote, I am confident that you would
surrender without counting the votes.
<!--l. 125--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I would like both our positions to be fairly stated and submitted to the
judgment of men who had plain common sense, without the prejudices of a learned
education. Let me be represented as one who trusts his senses, who thinks he knows
the things he sees and feels, and has no doubts about their existence; and you
fairly present yourself, armed with all your doubts, your paradoxes, and your
scepticism; and I shall willingly accept the decision of any unbiased person.
To me it is obvious that <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>spirit is the only substance in which ideas can exist.
And everyone agrees that <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>the objects we immediately perceive are ideas. And
no-one can deny that <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>sensible qualities are objects that we immediately perceive.
It is therefore evident there can&#8217;t be any <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">substratum </span>of those qualities; they
can exist in a spirit, not as qualities of it but as things perceived by it. So I
deny that there is any unthinking substratum of the objects of sense, and that
is the meaning of my denial that there is any material substance. But if by
&#8216;material substance&#8217; is meant only <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">sensible body</span>, that which is seen and felt (and I
dare say that unphilosophical people mean no more), then I am more certain of
matter&#8217;s existence than you or any other philosopher claim to be. If there is
anything that turns people in general off from the views that I support, it is the
mistaken idea that I deny the reality of sensible things. But it is you who are
guilty of that, not I, so what they are really hostile to are your notions, not
mine. I do therefore assert&#8212;as something I am as certain of as I am of my own
existence&#8212;that there are bodies or corporeal substances (meaning the things I perceive
by my senses). Most people will agree with this, and will neither think nor care
about the fate of those unknown natures and essences that some men are so fond
of.
<!--l. 127--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>What do you say to this? Since, according to you, men judge the reality of things by
their senses, how can a man be mistaken in thinking that the moon is a plain shining
surface, about a foot in diameter; or that a square tower seen at a distance is round; or
that an oar with one end in the water is crooked?
<!--l. 129--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>He is mistaken not with regard to the ideas he actually perceives, but in what he
infers from his present perceptions. Thus in the case of the oar, what he immediately
                                                                            
                                                                            
perceives by sight is certainly crooked; and to that extent he is right. But if he infers from
this that when he takes the oar out of the water he will see the same crookedness, or
that it will affect his sense of touch as crooked things usually do, in that he is
mistaken. Likewise, if from what he perceives in one place he infers that if he
moves closer to the moon or tower he will still experience similar ideas, he is
mistaken. But his mistake lies not in what he perceives immediately and at
present (for it is a manifest contradiction to suppose he could err about that),
but in the wrong judgment he makes concerning <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>the ideas he thinks to be
connected with the ones he immediately perceives; or concerning <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>the ideas
that&#8212;judging by what he perceives at present&#8212;he thinks would be perceived in other
circumstances. The case is the same with regard to the Copernican system. We don&#8217;t
perceive any motion of the earth while we are standing on it; but it would be
wrong to infer from this that if we were placed at as great a distance from earth
as we are now from the other planets we would not <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">then </span>perceive the earth&#8217;s
motion.
<!--l. 131--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I understand you; and I have to admit that what you say is plausible enough. Still,
let me remind you of something. Tell me, Philonous, weren&#8217;t you formerly as sure that
matter exists as you are now that it does not?
<!--l. 133--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I was. But here lies the difference. Before, my confidence was uncritically based on
prejudice; but my confidence now, after enquiry, rests on evidence.
<!--l. 135--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>After all, it seems that our dispute is about words rather than things. We agree in
the thing, but differ in the name. It is obvious that we are affected with ideas from
outside ourselves; and it is equally obvious that there must be powers outside the mind
corresponding to those ideas (I don&#8217;t say <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">resembling </span>them). And as these powers can&#8217;t
exist by themselves, we have to postulate some subject of them&#8212;<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>some <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">thing</span>
that <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">has </span>the powers<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>&#8212;which I call &#8216;matter&#8217;, and you call &#8216;spirit&#8217;. This is all the
difference.
<!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Hylas, is that powerful being, or subject of powers, extended?
<!--l. 139--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It isn&#8217;t; but it has the power to cause the idea of extension in you.
<!--l. 141--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>In itself, therefore, it is unextended.
<!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 145--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 147--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Without doubt: otherwise, how could we attribute powers to it?
<!--l. 149--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Now let me ask you two questions. First, does it conform to the usage of
philosophers or of non-philosophers to give the name &#8216;matter&#8217; to an unextended active
being? Second, isn&#8217;t it ridiculously absurd to misapply names contrary to the common use
of language?
<!--l. 151--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Well, then, let it not be called &#8216;matter&#8217;, since you insist, but some <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">third</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">nature </span>distinct from matter and spirit. For, what reason do you have to call it
&#8216;spirit&#8217;? Doesn&#8217;t the notion of <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">spirit </span>imply that it is thinking as well as active and
unextended?
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 153--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>My reason is as follows. I want to have some notion or meaning in what I say; but <span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">I</span>
<span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">have no notion of any action other than volition</span>, and I can&#8217;t conceive of volition as
being anywhere but in a spirit; so when I speak of an active being, I am obliged to mean a
spirit. Besides, it is quite obvious that a thing that can impart ideas to me must have
ideas in itself; and if a thing has ideas, surely it must be a spirit. <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>I shall state the case
differently<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>, to enable you to understand the point still more clearly, if that is
possible. I assert, as you do, that since we are affected from outside ourselves we
must accept that there are powers outside us in some being that is distinct
from ourselves. Up to here we are in agreement; but then we differ about what
kind of powerful being it is. I say it is spirit; you say that it is matter or else
some third kind of thing&#8212;I don&#8217;t know of what kind, and nor do you! Here is
how I prove it to be spirit. <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>From the effects I see produced, I infer that there
are actions; so there are volitions; so there must be a <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">will</span>. Again, <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>the things I
perceive (or things they are copied from) must exist outside my mind: but because
they are ideas, neither they nor things they are copied from can exist otherwise
than in an understanding; there is therefore an <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">understanding</span>. <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>But will and
understanding constitute in the strictest sense a mind or spirit. The powerful
cause of my ideas is, therefore, something that it is strictly proper to call &#8216;a
spirit&#8217;.
<!--l. 155--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I suppose you think you have made the point very clear, little suspecting that what
you propose leads directly to a contradiction. It is an absurdity to imagine any
imperfection in God, is it not?
<!--l. 157--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 163--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Are we not sometimes affected with pain and discomfort by some being other than
ourselves?
<!--l. 165--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>We are.
<!--l. 167--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>And haven&#8217;t you said that that being is a spirit, and is not that spirit
God?
<!--l. 169--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 171--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>But you have asserted that any ideas that we perceive from outside ourselves are in
the mind that affects us. It follows that the ideas of pain and discomfort are in God; or, in
other words, God suffers pain. That is to say that there is an imperfection in
the divine nature, which you agreed was absurd. So you are caught in a plain
contradiction.
<!--l. 173--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I don&#8217;t question that God knows or understands all things, including knowing what
pain is; he even knows every sort of painful sensation, and what it is for his
creatures to suffer pain. But I positively deny that God, though he knows and
sometimes causes painful sensations in us, can himself suffer pain. We who are
limited and dependent spirits are liable to sensory impressions&#8212;caused by an
external agent and produced against our wills&#8212;that are sometimes painful and
                                                                            
                                                                            
distressing. But God cannot suffer anything, or be affected with any painful
sensation, or indeed with any sensation at all, because: <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>no external being can
affect him, <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>he perceives nothing by sense as we do, <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>his will is absolute and
independent, causing all things and incapable of being thwarted or resisted by anything.
We are chained to a body; that is to say, our perceptions are connected with
bodily motions. By the law of our nature we undergo changes <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>in our minds<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>
with every alteration in the nervous parts of our sensible <span 
class="cmr-10">[</span><span 
class="cmr-9">= &#8216;perceptible&#8217;</span><span 
class="cmr-10">] </span>body;
this sensible body is really nothing but a complex of qualities or ideas that
have no existence other than through being perceived by a mind; so that this
connection of sensations with bodily motions comes down to a mere correspondence
in the order of nature between two sets of ideas or immediately perceivable
things&#8212;<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>the set of ideas perceived by someone&#8217;s mind, and the set constituting
his body<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>. In contrast with this, God is a pure spirit, disengaged from all such
correspondences or linkages according to laws of nature. No bodily motions are
accompanied by sensations of pain or pleasure in his mind. To know everything
knowable is certainly a perfection; but to endure, or suffer, or feel anything
through the senses is an imperfection. The former, I repeat, fits God, but not the
latter. God knows or has ideas; but his ideas aren&#8217;t conveyed to him by sense as
ours are. What led you to think you saw an absurdity where really there is
none was your failure to attend to this obvious difference between God and his
creatures.

the velocities of two bodies are equal, therefore, their quantities of motion are
directly proportional to the quantity of matter in each. But it has been found
by experience that all bodies (not counting small inequalities arising from the
resistance of the air) fall with an equal velocity; and so the motion of falling bodies
(and consequently their gravity, which is the cause or source of that motion) is
proportional to the quantity of matter they contain; which is what I was to
demonstrate.
<!--l. 181--><p class="noindent" ><span

proposition from which the existence of <span

matter?

not?

idea in our minds with the help of <span

said against matter as nothing; but if you can&#8217;t, you will get nowhere by urging the
explanation of phenomena. It is easy to understand that a being endowed with knowledge
and will should produce or display ideas; but I can never understand how a
being that is utterly destitute of knowledge and will could produce ideas or in
any way to affect a mind. Even if we had some positive conception of matter,
knew its qualities, and could comprehend its existence, it would still be so far
from <span

nothing; for by observing and reasoning about connections of ideas they discover
the laws and methods of nature, which is a useful and interesting branch of
knowledge.

better?
<!--l. 230--><p class="noindent" ><span

object perceived through the microscope isn&#8217;t the same one that was perceived
by the naked eye. But if every variation were thought sufficient to constitute
a new kind or new individual, language would be made useless by the sheer
number of names or by confusions amongst them. Therefore, to avoid this and
other inconveniences (you&#8217;ll easily see what they are if you think about it), men
                                                                            
                                                                            
in their thought and language treat as <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">one thing </span>a number of ideas that are
observed to have some connection in nature (either occurring together or in
sequence), although the ideas are <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>certainly distinct from one another, because
they are<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>perceived through different senses, or through one sense at different
times or in different circumstances. So when I see a thing and then proceed to
examine it by my other senses, I&#8217;m not trying to understand better the same
object that I had seen. <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>That can&#8217;t be what I am doing, because<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>the object of
one sense can&#8217;t be perceived by the other senses. And when I look through a
microscope, it isn&#8217;t so as to perceive more clearly what I had already perceived
with my bare eyes, because the objects perceived in these two ways are quite
different from one another. In each case, all I want is to know what ideas are
connected together; and the more a man knows of the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">connection of ideas </span>the more
he is said to know of the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">nature of things</span>. If our ideas are variable, and our
senses are not always affected with the same appearances&#8212;what of it? It doesn&#8217;t
follow that they aren&#8217;t to be trusted, or that they are inconsistent either with
themselves or with anything else, except for your preconceived notion that each name
stands for I know not what single, unchanged, unperceivable &#8216;real nature&#8217;; a
prejudice that seems to have arisen from a failure to understand the common
language that people use when speaking of <span

<span

<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">notions </span>as on <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">words</span>, which were invented by the common people merely for
convenience and efficiency in the common actions of life, without any regard to
theories.
<!--l. 232--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 234--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>You hold that the ideas we perceive by our senses are not real things but images
or copies of them. So our knowledge is real only to the extent that our ideas
are the true representations of those originals. But as these supposed originals
(<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>or real things<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>) are in themselves unknown, we can&#8217;t know how far our ideas
resemble them, or indeed whether they resemble them at all. So we can&#8217;t be sure
that we have any real knowledge. Furthermore, while the supposed real things
remain unchanged our ideas keep changing; so they can&#8217;t <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">all </span>be true copies of the
real things; and if some are and others are not, we can&#8217;t tell which are which.
This plunges us yet deeper into uncertainty. Again, when we think about it we
can&#8217;t conceive how any idea, <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">or anything like an idea</span>, could have an absolute
existence out of any mind; from which it follows, according to your views, that we
can&#8217;t conceive how there should be any <span

class="tcrm-1200">·</span>because you say
that real things are like ideas<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>. The result of all this is that we are hopelessly
lost in scepticism. Now let me ask you four questions. First, <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>doesn&#8217;t all this
scepticism arise from your relating ideas to certain absolutely existing unperceived
substances, as their originals? Secondly, <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>are you informed, either by sense or
reason, of the existence of those unknown originals? And if you are not, isn&#8217;t it
absurd to suppose that they exist? Thirdly, <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>when you look into it, do you find
that there is anything distinctly conceived or meant by the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">absolute or external</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">existence of unperceiving substances</span>? Lastly, <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>having considered the premises
                                                                            
                                                                            
<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>that I have put to you<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>, isn&#8217;t it wisest to follow nature, trust your senses, lay
aside all anxious thoughts about unknown natures or substances, and join the
common people in taking the things that are perceived by the senses to be real
things?
<!--l. 236--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Just now I am not inclined to answer your questions. I would much rather see how
you can answer mine. Aren&#8217;t the objects perceived by one person&#8217;s senses also perceivable
by others who are present? If there were a hundred more people here, they would all see
the garden, the trees, and flowers as I see them. But they don&#8217;t experience in the same
way the ideas that I form in my imagination. Doesn&#8217;t this make a difference between the
former sort of objects and the latter?
<!--l. 238--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I agree that it does; and I have never denied that the objects of sense are different
from those of imagination. But what would you infer from this? You can&#8217;t say
that sensible objects exist unperceived because they are perceived by many
people.
<!--l. 240--><p class="noindent" ><span

another. Isn&#8217;t it your opinion that all we perceive through our senses are the ideas
existing in our minds?
<!--l. 242--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>It is.
<!--l. 244--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>But the idea that is in my mind can&#8217;t be in yours, or in any other mind. So doesn&#8217;t
it follow from your principles that no two people can see the same thing? And isn&#8217;t this
highly absurd?
<!--l. 246--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>If the term &#8216;same&#8217; be given its common meaning, it is certain (and not at all in
conflict with the principles I maintain) that different persons may perceive the same
thing; and that the same thing or idea can exist in different minds. The meanings of
words are assigned by us; and since men customarily apply the word &#8216;same&#8217; where no
distinction or variety <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">is perceived</span>, and I don&#8217;t claim to alter their perceptions, it follows
that as men have sometimes said &#8216;Several people saw the same thing&#8217;, they may
continue to talk like that in similar situations, without deviating either from
correctness of language or the truth of things. But if the term &#8216;same&#8217; is used in a
meaning given to it by philosophers who claim to have an <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">abstracted notion of</span>
<span

class="cmti-10x-x-109">that </span>sense it may or may not be possible for different people to
perceive the same thing&#8212;depending on their various definitions of this notion (for
it isn&#8217;t yet agreed what that philosophical identity consists in). But whether
philosophers shall think fit to call a thing &#8216;the same&#8217; or not is of small importance, I
think. Let us suppose a group of men together, all having the same faculties and
consequently affected in similar ways by their senses, but with no use of language.
There is no doubt that they would agree in their perceptions. But when they
came to the use of speech, <span

Some of them, impressed by <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>the uniformness of what was perceived, might
speak of &#8216;the same thing&#8217;; while others, struck by <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>the diversity of the people
whose perceptions were in question, might speak of &#8216;different things&#8217;. But can&#8217;t
anyone see that all the dispute is about a <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">word</span>&#8212;namely, a dispute over whether
what is perceived by different people can have the term &#8216;same&#8217; applied to it? Or
suppose a house whose outer walls remain unaltered while the rooms are all pulled
                                                                            
                                                                            
down and new ones built in their place. If you were to say that we still have &#8216;the
same&#8217; house, and I said it wasn&#8217;t the same, wouldn&#8217;t we nevertheless perfectly
agree in our <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">thoughts </span>about the house considered in itself? Wouldn&#8217;t all the
difference consist in a sound? If you were to say that in that case we <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">do </span>differ in our
notions, because your idea of the house includes the simple abstracted idea
of <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">identity </span>whereas mine does not, I would tell you that I don&#8217;t know what
you mean by that &#8216;abstracted idea of identity&#8217;; and I would invite you to look
into your own thoughts, and make sure that you understood yourself.&#8212;Why so
silent, Hylas? Aren&#8217;t you satisfied <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">yet </span>that men can dispute about identity and
non-identity without any real difference in their thoughts and opinions, apart
from names? Take this further thought with you: that this point still stands,
whether matter exists or not. For the materialists themselves admit that what we
immediately perceive by our senses are our own ideas. So your difficulty&#8212;that
no two see the same thing&#8212;holds as much against the materialists as against
me.
<!--l. 248--><p class="noindent" ><span

Anyway, on my principles also you can suppose that ideas are copies of something

to exist in that mind which includes all things. This thing-that-is-copied serves all the
ends of identity&#8212;<span

<!--l. 258--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>And what more should we be concerned with? I see this cherry, I feel it, I taste it;

it is therefore real. Take away the sensations of softness, moisture, redness, tartness, and
you take away the cherry. Since it is not a thing distinct from sensations, a cherry&#8212;I
repeat&#8212;is nothing but a heap of sensible impressions, or ideas perceived by various
senses. These ideas are united into one thing (or have one name given to them) by the
mind, because they are observed to accompany each other. Thus when the palate is
affected with a certain taste, the sight is affected with a red colour, the sense of
touch with roundness, softness, etc. And when I see and feel and taste in certain
particular ways, I am sure that the cherry exists, or is real; because I don&#8217;t
think its reality is anything apart from those sensations. But if by the word
                                                                            
                                                                            
&#8216;cherry&#8217; you mean an unknown nature distinct from all those sensible qualities,
and by its &#8216;existence&#8217; you mean something distinct from its being perceived,
then indeed I agree that neither you nor I nor anyone else can be sure that it
exists.

<!--l. 278--><p class="noindent" ><span

the senses, I don&#8217;t mean these in the crude literal sense, as when bodies are said to exist
&#8216;in&#8217; a place or a seal to make an &#8216;impression&#8217; on wax. I mean only that the mind
comprehends or perceives them; and that it is affected from outside, or by some being
other than itself. This is my explanation of your difficulty; I would like to know
how it can help to make intelligible your thesis of an unperceiving material
substratum.
<!--l. 280--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>No, if that&#8217;s all there is to it, I admit that I don&#8217;t see what use can be made of it.
But are you not guilty of some misuse of language in this?
<!--l. 282--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>None at all. I have merely followed what is authorized by common custom, which as
you know is what sets the rules for language. For nothing is more usual than for
philosophers to speak of the immediate objects of the understanding as things existing &#8216;in&#8217;
the mind. And this fits with the general analogy of language: most mental operations are
signified by words borrowed from sensible things, as can be seen in the terms
&#8216;comprehend&#8217; <span

<!--l. 284--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>You have, I admit, satisfied me about this. But there still remains one great
difficulty, which I don&#8217;t see how you can overcome. Indeed, it is of such importance that
even if you can solve all others, if you can&#8217;t find a solution for this difficulty you mustn&#8217;t
expect to make a convert out of me.
<!--l. 286--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Let me know this mighty difficulty.
<!--l. 288--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>The scriptural account of the creation appears to me to be utterly incompatible
with your notions. Moses tells us of a creation: a creation of what? of ideas?
No, certainly, but of <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">things</span>, of real things, solid corporeal substances. Get your
principles to conform with this and I shall perhaps agree with you <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>about them in
general<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>.
<!--l. 290--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Moses mentions the sun, moon, and stars, earth and sea, plants and animals: I
don&#8217;t question that all these do really exist, and were in the beginning created by God. If
by &#8216;ideas&#8217; you mean fictions and fancies of the mind, then the sun, moon, etc. are no
ideas. If by &#8216;ideas&#8217; you mean immediate objects of the understanding, or sensible things
that can&#8217;t exist unperceived or out of a mind, then those things are ideas. But
it matters little whether you call them &#8216;ideas&#8217; or not. That difference is only
about a name. And whether that name be retained or rejected, the sense, the
truth and reality of things, continues the same. In common talk, the objects
of our senses are not called &#8216;ideas&#8217;, but &#8216;things&#8217;. You&#8217;ll have no quarrel with
me if you go on calling them &#8216;things&#8217;, provided you don&#8217;t attribute to them
any absolute external existence. So I accept that the creation was a creation of
things, of real things. This isn&#8217;t in the least inconsistent with my principles,
as is evident from what I have just been saying, and would have been evident
to you without that, if you hadn&#8217;t forgotten what I so often said before. As
for solid corporeal substances, please show where Moses makes any mention of
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">them</span>; and if they should be mentioned by him or any other inspired writer, it
would still be up to you to show that in such texts those words were not used in
the common meaning, as referring to things falling under our senses, but in
the philosophical meaning as standing for matter, or an unknown something,
with an absolute <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>mind-independent<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>existence. When you have proved these
points, then (and not till then) you may bring the authority of Moses into our
dispute.
<!--l. 292--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>It is useless to dispute about a point that is so clear. I am content to refer it to your
own conscience. Can&#8217;t you see that your views conflict in a special way with Moses&#8217;
account of the creation?
<!--l. 294--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>If the first chapter of Genesis can be given any possible sense that makes it square

conflict with mine. And any such sense can be conceived by <span

believe what I believe. All you can conceive apart from spirits are ideas, and <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">their</span>
existence I don&#8217;t deny. And you <span

<!--l. 296--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 298--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Why, I imagine that if I had been present at the creation, I would have seen things
                                                                            
                                                                            
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">come into existence</span>&#8212;that is, <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">become perceptible</span>&#8212;in the order described by
Moses. I have always believed Moses&#8217; account of the creation, and I don&#8217;t find
that my manner of believing it has altered in any way. When things are said to
begin or end their existence, we mean this with regard not to God but to his
creatures. All objects are eternally known by God, or (the same thing) have an
eternal existence in his mind; but when things that were previously imperceptible
to creatures are by a decree of God made perceptible to them, then are they
said to <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>&#8216;come into existence&#8217;, in the sense that they<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>begin a relative existence
with respect to created minds. So when I read Moses&#8217; account of the creation, I
understand that the various parts of the world gradually became perceivable to finite
spirits that were endowed with proper faculties; so that when such spirits were
present, the things were in truth perceived by them. This is the literal, obvious
sense suggested to me by the words of the holy scripture; and in it there is no
mention and no thought of substratum, instrument, occasion, or absolute existence.
And if you look into it I am sure you will find that most plain, honest men
who believe the creation never think of those things any more than I do. What
metaphysical sense <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">you </span>may understand the creation story in, only you can
tell.
<!--l. 300--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>But, Philonous, you seem not to be aware <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>of a terrific problem confronting you,
arising from the fact<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>that according to you created things in the beginning had only a
relative existence, and thus a hypothetical existence; that is to say, they existed <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">if </span>there
were men to perceive them. You don&#8217;t allow them any actuality of absolute existence
that would have enabled God to create them and not taken the further step of
creating men. So don&#8217;t you have to say that it&#8217;s plainly impossible that inanimate
things were created before man was? And isn&#8217;t this directly contrary to Moses&#8217;
account?
<!--l. 302--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>In answer to that I say, first, created beings might begin to exist in the mind of
other created intelligences besides men. To prove any contradiction between Moses&#8217;
account and my notions you must first show that there was no other order of finite
created spirits in existence before men. For my second reply, let us think of the creation
as it was at the end of the fourth day, a collection of plants of all sorts, produced by an
invisible power, in a desert where nobody was present. I say <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>that this way of thinking
about the creation is consistent with my principles, since they deprive you of nothing
sensible and nothing imaginable; <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>that it exactly suits with the common, natural,
uncorrupted notions of mankind; <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>that it brings out the dependence of all things on
God, and consequently has all the good effect or influence which that important
article of our faith could possibly have in making men humble, thankful, and
resigned to their creator. I say, furthermore, <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>that in this naked conception
of things, with words stripped off, you won&#8217;t find any notion of what you call
the &#8216;actuality of absolute existence&#8217;. You may indeed raise a dust with those
terms, and so pointlessly lengthen our dispute. But I beg you to look calmly into
your own thoughts, and then tell me if they aren&#8217;t useless and unintelligible
jargon.
<!--l. 304--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I admit that I have no very clear notion annexed to them. But what do you say
to this? Don&#8217;t you make the existence of sensible things consist in their being
                                                                            
                                                                            
in a mind? And weren&#8217;t all things eternally in the mind of God? Didn&#8217;t they
therefore exist from all eternity, according to you? How could something that was
eternal be created in time? Can anything be clearer or better reasoned than
this?
<!--l. 306--><p class="noindent" ><span

laws of nature&#8217;. You may call this a relative or hypothetical existence if you please. But
so long as <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>it supplies us with the most natural, obvious, and literal sense of
Moses&#8217; history of the creation; so long as <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>it answers all the religious ends of that
great article of faith; in a word, so long as <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>you can assign no other sense or
meaning in place of it; why should we reject this? Is it to comply with a ridiculous
sceptical desire to make everything nonsense and unintelligible? I am sure you can&#8217;t
say it is for the glory of God. For even if it were possible and conceivable that
the physical world should have an absolute existence outside the mind of God,
as well as of the minds of all created spirits, how could this display either the
immensity or the omniscience of the Deity, or the necessary and immediate
dependence of all things on him? Wouldn&#8217;t it indeed seem rather to detract from those
attributes?
<!--l. 320--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>Well, let us look into this decree of God&#8217;s that things should become perceptible.

class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>at
some particular time he began to will what he hadn&#8217;t actually willed before but only
planned to will? If the former, then there could be no creation or beginning
of existence for finite things. If the latter, then we must think that something
new happened to God, which implies a sort of change; and all change points to
imperfection.
<!--l. 322--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>Please think what you are doing! Isn&#8217;t it obvious that this objection counts equally
against a creation in <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">any </span>sense; indeed, that it counts against every other act of God&#8217;s
that we can discover by the light of nature? We can&#8217;t conceive any act of God&#8217;s
otherwise than as performed in time, and having a beginning. God is a being of
transcendent and unlimited perfections; so finite spirits can&#8217;t understand his
nature. It isn&#8217;t to be expected, therefore, that any man, whether materialist or
immaterialist, should have exactly correct notions of the Deity, his attributes,
and his ways of doing things. So if you want to infer anything against me, your
                                                                            
                                                                            
difficulty mustn&#8217;t be drawn from the inadequateness of our conceptions of the divine
nature, which is unavoidable on any system; it must rather come from my denial
of matter, of which there isn&#8217;t one word said or hinted in what you have just
objected.
<!--l. 324--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I have to agree that the only difficulties you have to clear up are ones that arise
from the non-existence of matter, and are special to that thesis. You are right about that.
But I simply can&#8217;t bring myself to think there is no such special conflict between
the creation and your opinion; though I am not clear about where exactly it
is.
<!--l. 326--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>What more do you want? Don&#8217;t I acknowledge a twofold state of things,
the one copied or natural, the other copied-from and eternal? The former was
created in time; the latter existed from everlasting in the mind of God. Isn&#8217;t this
in harmony with what theologians generally say? Is anything more than this
necessary in order to conceive the creation? But you suspect some special conflict,
though you cannot locate it. To take away all possibility of doubt about all
this, just consider this one point. Either you can&#8217;t conceive the creation on any
hypothesis whatsoever, in which case you have no ground for dislike or complaint
against my thesis in particular; or you can conceive the creation, and in that case
why not conceive it on my principles, since that would not take away anything
conceivable? My principles have all along allowed you the full scope of sense,
imagination, and reason. So anything that you could previously apprehend,
either immediately by your senses or mediately by inferences from your senses,
anything you could perceive, imagine, or understand, remains still with you <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>on my
principles<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>. If therefore the notion you have of the creation by other principles
is intelligible, you still have it on mine; if it isn&#8217;t intelligible, I don&#8217;t think it
is a notion at all, and so the loss of it is no loss. And indeed it seems to me
quite clear that the supposition of matter&#8212;something perfectly unknown and
inconceivable&#8212;can&#8217;t enable us to conceive <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">anything</span>. And I hope I don&#8217;t need to prove to
you that the inference from <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">The creation is inconceivable without matter </span>to
<span

conceivable.

sciences depend on the infinite divisibility of finite extended things, and that depends on
the supposition of absolutely existing extended things. But what need is there to
insist on particular sciences? Isn&#8217;t the opposition to all systematic knowledge

foundation? Can you produce so much as <span

or on behalf of that professed utter ignorance of their natures, which doesn&#8217;t
presuppose that their reality consists in an external absolute existence? Once
that presupposition is made, the objections from the change of colours in a
pigeon&#8217;s neck, or the broken appearance of an oar in the water, do have weight.
But objections like those vanish if we don&#8217;t maintain the existence of absolute
external originals, but place the reality of things in ideas. Although these ideas
are fleeting and changeable, they are changed not at random but according to
the fixed order of nature. For it is <span

matter. If it doesn&#8217;t, then arguing from it to the falsity of immaterialism is
<span

better than arguing from &#8216;Extension is infinitely divisible&#8217; to &#8216;God does not have
foreknowledge&#8217;! And yet if you think back I believe you will find this to have
been often, if not always, the case <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>in our conversation<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>. Be careful also not to
argue by begging the question <span 
class="cmr-10">[</span><span 
class="cmr-9">that is, giving an argument that at the outset assumes</span>
<span 
class="cmr-9">the truth of the conclusion</span><span 
class="cmr-10">]</span>. One is apt to say: &#8216;The unknown substances ought to
be regarded as real things, rather than the ideas in our minds; and for all we
know the unthinking external substance may operate as a cause or instrument
in the production of our ideas.&#8217; But doesn&#8217;t this assume that there are such
external substances? And isn&#8217;t this begging the question? But above all things you
should beware of misleading yourself by that common fallacy which is called
&#8216;mistaking the question&#8217;&#8212;<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>that is, offering against one proposition an argument which
really counts only against a quite different proposition<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>. You often talked as if
you thought I maintained the non-existence of sensible things; whereas in truth
no-one can be more thoroughly assured of their existence than I am, and it is
you who doubt&#8212;no; it is you who positively <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">deny</span>&#8212;that they exist. Everything
that is seen, felt, heard, or in any way perceived by the senses is a real being
according to the principles I embrace, but not according to <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>the principles that used
to be<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>yours. Remember that the matter you <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>used to<span 
class="tcrm-1200">· </span>defend is an unknown
something (if indeed it can even be called a &#8216;something&#8217;), which is completely
stripped of all sensible qualities, and can&#8217;t be perceived through the senses or
grasped by the mind. Remember, I say, that your <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">matter </span>is not any object that
is hard or soft, hot or cold, blue or white, round or square, etc. For I affirm
that all <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">these </span>things <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">do </span>exist; though I do indeed deny that they exist in any
way except by being perceived, or that they exist out of all minds whatsoever.
Think about these points; consider them attentively and keep them in view.
Otherwise you won&#8217;t be clear about the state of the question; and in that case your
objections will always be wide of the mark, and instead of counting against my

yours.
<!--l. 397--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Hyl: </span>I have to admit, Philonous, that nothing seems to have kept me from agreeing with
you more than this same mistaking the question <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>that you have just warned me against<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>.
When you deny <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">matter </span>I am tempted at first glance to think that you are denying the
things we see and feel; but on reflection I find there is no ground for that. How about
keeping the word &#8216;matter&#8217;, and applying it to sensible things? This could be
done without any change in your views; and believe me it would reconcile your
views to some people who are upset more by your use of words than by your
opinions.
<!--l. 399--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>With all my heart: retain the word &#8216;matter&#8217;, and apply it to the objects of sense, if
you please, but don&#8217;t credit them with existing apart from being perceived. I shan&#8217;t
quarrel with you over a word. &#8216;Matter&#8217; and &#8216;material substance&#8217; are terms introduced by
philosophers; and as used by them they imply a sort of independence, or an existence
distinct from being perceived by a mind. But common people don&#8217;t use these terms, or if
they do it is to signify the immediate objects of sense. So one would think that so long as
the names of all particular things are retained, and also such terms as &#8216;sensible&#8217;,
&#8216;substance&#8217;, &#8216;body&#8217;, and &#8216;stuff&#8217;, the word &#8216;matter&#8217; would never be missed in common
talk. And in philosophical discourses it seems best to leave it out altogether,
since the use of that general confused term&#8212;more perhaps than any other one
factor&#8212;has favoured and strengthened the depraved tendency of the mind towards
atheism.

substance exterior to the mind, I think you should allow me the privilege of using the

mind. I freely grant that strictly speaking there is no other substance than spirit. But I
have been accustomed to the term &#8216;matter&#8217; for so long that I don&#8217;t know how to get on

a dispute between you and ordinary folk. It<span

so agreeable to the common sense of mankind and to holy scripture as yours
are. All our desires are directed towards gaining happiness or avoiding misery.
But what have happiness or misery, joy or grief, pleasure or pain, to do with
absolute existence, or with unknown entities, abstracted from all relation to
us? It is obvious that things concern us only insofar as they are pleasing or
displeasing; and they can please or displease only to the extent that they are
perceived. Beyond that, we are not concerned; and in this respect you leave
things as you found them. But still there is something new in this doctrine <span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>of
yours<span 
class="tcrm-1200">·</span>. It is clear to me that I don&#8217;t now think with the philosophers, nor do I
entirely think with the common people. I would like to know where I stand
now&#8212;to know precisely what you have added to my former notions or altered in
them.
<!--l. 407--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Phil: </span>I don&#8217;t claim to be a setter-up of new notions. All I&#8217;m trying to do is bring
together and place in a clearer light a truth that used to be shared between
<span

class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>the philosophers: the former being of the opinion
that <span

that <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&bull;</span>the things they immediately perceive are ideas which exist only in the
mind. These two notions, when put together, constitute the substance of what I
advance.

dim light, and through false glasses. Now the glasses are removed, and a new
light breaks in on my understanding. I am clearly convinced that I see things as
they are, and am no longer troubled about their unknown natures or absolute
existence. This is the state I find myself in at present, though indeed I don&#8217;t yet
fully grasp the line of argument that brought me to it. You set out on the same
principles that Academics <span 
class="cmr-10">[</span><span 
class="cmr-9">= sceptics in ancient Greece</span><span 
class="cmr-10">]</span>, Cartesians, and similar
sects usually do; and for a long time it looked as if you were advancing their
philosophical scepticism; but in the end your conclusions are directly opposite to
theirs.

column, to a certain height, at which it breaks and falls back into the basin from which it
rose. Its ascent, as well as its descent, come from the same uniform law or principle of
gravitation. In just that way the same principles which at first view lead to
scepticism then, when pursued to a certain point, bring men back to common
sense.
